MySQL Glossary


# MySQL Glossary

These terms are commonly used in information about the MySQL
database server.

### A

.ARM file

Metadata for `ARCHIVE` tables. Contrast with
**.ARZ file**. Files with this
extension are always included in backups produced by the
`mysqlbackup` command of the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product.


See Also [.ARZ file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_arz_file), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

.ARZ file

Data for ARCHIVE tables. Contrast with
**.ARM file**. Files with this
extension are always included in backups produced by the
`mysqlbackup` command of the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product.


See Also [.ARM file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_arm_file), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

ACID

An acronym standing for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and
durability. These properties are all desirable in a database
system, and are all closely tied to the notion of a
**transaction**. The transactional
features of `InnoDB` adhere to the ACID
principles.


Transactions are **atomic** units
of work that can be **committed**
or **rolled back**. When a
transaction makes multiple changes to the database, either all
the changes succeed when the transaction is committed, or all
the changes are undone when the transaction is rolled back.


The database remains in a consistent state at all times —
after each commit or rollback, and while transactions are in
progress. If related data is being updated across multiple
tables, queries see either all old values or all new values, not
a mix of old and new values.


Transactions are protected (isolated) from each other while they
are in progress; they cannot interfere with each other or see
each other's uncommitted data. This isolation is achieved
through the **locking** mechanism.
Experienced users can adjust the **isolation**
**level**, trading off less protection in favor of
increased performance and
**concurrency**, when they can be
sure that the transactions really do not interfere with each
other.


The results of transactions are durable: once a commit operation
succeeds, the changes made by that transaction are safe from
power failures, system crashes, race conditions, or other
potential dangers that many non-database applications are
vulnerable to. Durability typically involves writing to disk
storage, with a certain amount of redundancy to protect against
power failures or software crashes during write operations. (In
`InnoDB`, the **doublewrite**
**buffer** assists with durability.)


See Also [atomic](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_atomic), [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [concurrency](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_concurrency), [doublewrite buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_doublewrite_buffer), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

adaptive flushing

An algorithm for **InnoDB** tables
that smooths out the I/O overhead introduced by
**checkpoints**. Instead of
**flushing** all modified
**pages** from the
**buffer pool** to the
**data files** at once, MySQL
periodically flushes small sets of modified pages. The adaptive
flushing algorithm extends this process by estimating the
optimal rate to perform these periodic flushes, based on the
rate of flushing and how fast
**redo** information is generated.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [checkpoint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_checkpoint), [data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page), [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log).

adaptive hash index

An optimization for `InnoDB` tables that can
speed up lookups using `=` and
`IN` operators, by constructing a
**hash index** in memory. MySQL
monitors index searches for `InnoDB` tables,
and if queries could benefit from a hash index, it builds one
automatically for index **pages**
that are frequently accessed. In a sense, the adaptive hash
index configures MySQL at runtime to take advantage of ample
main memory, coming closer to the architecture of main-memory
databases. This feature is controlled by the
[`innodb_adaptive_hash_index`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_adaptive_hash_index)
configuration option. Because this feature benefits some
workloads and not others, and the memory used for the hash index
is reserved in the **buffer pool**,
typically you should benchmark with this feature both enabled
and disabled.


The hash index is always built based on an existing
**B-tree** index on the table.
MySQL can build a hash index on a prefix of any length of the
key defined for the B-tree, depending on the pattern of searches
against the index. A hash index can be partial; the whole B-tree
index does not need to be cached in the buffer pool.


See Also [B-tree](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_b_tree), [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [hash index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hash_index), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page), [secondary index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_secondary_index).

ADO.NET

An object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for applications
built using .NET technologies such as
**ASP.NET**. Such applications can
interface with MySQL through the
**Connector/NET** component.


See Also [.NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos__net), [ASP.net](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_asp_net), [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_net), [Mono](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mono), [Visual Studio](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_visual_studio).

AIO

Acronym for **asynchronous I/O**.
You might see this acronym in `InnoDB` messages
or keywords.


See Also [asynchronous I/O](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_asynchronous_io).

ANSI

In **ODBC**, an alternative method
of supporting character sets and other internationalization
aspects. Contrast with **Unicode**.
**Connector/ODBC** 3.51 is an ANSI
driver, while Connector/ODBC 5.1 is a Unicode driver.


See Also [Connector/ODBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_odbc), [ODBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_odbc), [Unicode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_unicode).

API

APIs provide low-level access to the MySQL protocol and MySQL
resources from **client** programs.
Contrast with the higher-level access provided by a
**Connector**.


See Also [C API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_c_api), [client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_client), [connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector), [native C API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_native_c_api), [Perl API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_perl_api), [PHP API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_php_api), [Python API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_python_api), [Ruby API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ruby_api).

application programming interface (API)

A set of functions or procedures. An API provides a stable set
of names and types for functions, procedures, parameters, and
return values.


apply

When a backup produced by the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product does not include
the most recent changes that occurred while the backup was
underway, the process of updating the backup files to include
those changes is known as the
**apply** step. It is specified by
the `apply-log` option of the
`mysqlbackup` command.


Before the changes are applied, we refer to the files as a
**raw backup**. After the changes
are applied, we refer to the files as a
**prepared backup**. The changes
are recorded in the
**ibbackup\_logfile** file; once the
apply step is finished, this file is no longer necessary.


See Also [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup), [ibbackup\_logfile](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ibbackup_logfile), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [prepared backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_prepared_backup), [raw backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_raw_backup).

AS

A Kerberos authentication server. AS can also refer to the
authentication service provided by an authentication server.


See Also [authentication server](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_authentication_server).

ASP.net

A framework for developing web-based applications using
**.NET** technologies and
languages. Such applications can interface with MySQL through
the **Connector/NET** component.


Another technology for writing server-side web pages with MySQL
is **PHP**.


See Also [.NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos__net), [ADO.NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ado_net), [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_net), [Mono](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mono), [PHP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_php), [Visual Studio](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_visual_studio).

assembly

A library of compiled code in a
**.NET** system, accessed through
**Connector/NET**. Stored in the
**GAC** to allow versioning without
naming conflicts.


See Also [.NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos__net), [GAC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_gac).

asynchronous I/O

A type of I/O operation that allows other processing to proceed
before the I/O is completed. Also known as
**nonblocking I/O** and abbreviated
as **AIO**.
`InnoDB` uses this type of I/O for certain
operations that can run in parallel without affecting the
reliability of the database, such as reading pages into the
**buffer pool** that have not
actually been requested, but might be needed soon.


Historically, `InnoDB` used asynchronous I/O on
Windows systems only. Starting with the InnoDB Plugin 1.1 and
MySQL 5.5, `InnoDB ` uses asynchronous I/O on
Linux systems. This change introduces a dependency on
`libaio`. Asynchronous I/O on Linux systems is
configured using the
[`innodb_use_native_aio`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_use_native_aio) option,
which is enabled by default. On other Unix-like systems, InnoDB
uses synchronous I/O only.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [nonblocking I/O](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_non_blocking_io).

atomic

In the SQL context,
**transactions** are units of work
that either succeed entirely (when
**committed**) or have no effect at
all (when **rolled back**). The
indivisible ("atomic") property of transactions is the
“A” in the acronym
**ACID**.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

atomic DDL

An atomic _DDL_ statement is one that
combines the _data dictionary_ updates,
_storage engine_ operations, and
_binary log_ writes associated with a DDL
operation into a single, atomic transaction. The transaction is
either fully committed or rolled back, even if the server halts
during the operation. Atomic DDL support was added in MySQL 8.0.
For more information, see [Section 15.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/atomic-ddl.html "15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support").


See Also [binary log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_binary_log), [data dictionary](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_dictionary), [DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ddl), [storage engine](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_storage_engine).

atomic instruction

Special instructions provided by the CPU, to ensure that
critical low-level operations cannot be interrupted.


authentication server

In Kerberos, a service that provides the initial ticket needed
to obtain a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) that is needed to
obtain other tickets from the ticket-granting server (TGS). The
authentication server (AS) combined with a TGS make up a key
distribution center (KDC).


See Also [key distribution center](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_key_distribution_center), [ticket-granting server](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ticket_granting_server).

auto-increment

A property of a table column (specified by the
`AUTO_INCREMENT` keyword) that automatically
adds an ascending sequence of values in the column.


It saves work for the developer, not to have to produce new
unique values when inserting new rows. It provides useful
information for the query optimizer, because the column is known
to be not null and with unique values. The values from such a
column can be used as lookup keys in various contexts, and
because they are auto-generated there is no reason to ever
change them; for this reason, primary key columns are often
specified as auto-incrementing.


Auto-increment columns can be problematic with statement-based
replication, because replaying the statements on a replica might
not produce the same set of column values as on the source, due
to timing issues. When you have an auto-incrementing primary
key, you can use statement-based replication only with the
setting
[`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=1`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode). If
you have
[`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode),
which allows higher concurrency for insert operations, use
**row-based replication** rather
than **statement-based**
**replication**. The setting
[`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=0`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
should not be used except for compatibility purposes.


Consecutive lock mode
( [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=1`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)) is
the default setting prior to MySQL 8.0.3. As of MySQL 8.0.3,
interleaved lock mode
( [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)) is
the default, which reflects the change from statement-based to
row-based replication as the default replication type.


See Also [auto-increment locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_auto_increment_locking), [innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode), [primary key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_primary_key), [row-based replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_based_replication), [statement-based replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_statement_based_replication).

auto-increment locking

The convenience of an
**auto-increment** primary key
involves some tradeoff with concurrency. In the simplest case,
if one transaction is inserting values into the table, any other
transactions must wait to do their own inserts into that table,
so that rows inserted by the first transaction receive
consecutive primary key values. `InnoDB`
includes optimizations and the
[`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode) option
so that you can configure and optimal balance between
predictable sequences of auto-increment values and maximum
**concurrency** for insert
operations.


See Also [auto-increment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_auto_increment), [concurrency](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_concurrency), [innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode).

autocommit

A setting that causes a **commit**
operation after each **SQL**
statement. This mode is not recommended for working with
`InnoDB` tables with
**transactions** that span several
statements. It can help performance for
**read-only transactions** on
`InnoDB` tables, where it minimizes overhead
from **locking** and generation of
**undo** data, especially in MySQL
5.6.4 and up. It is also appropriate for working with
[`MyISAM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/myisam-storage-engine.html "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables, where transactions
are not applicable.


See Also [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [read-only transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_only_transaction), [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sql), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction), [undo](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo).

availability

The ability to cope with, and if necessary recover from,
failures on the host, including failures of MySQL, the operating
system, or the hardware and maintenance activity that may
otherwise cause downtime. Often paired with
**scalability** as critical aspects
of a large-scale deployment.


See Also [scalability](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_scalability).

MySQL Enterprise Backup

A licensed product that performs **hot**
**backups** of MySQL databases. It offers the most
efficiency and flexibility when backing up
[`InnoDB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables, but can also back up
[`MyISAM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/myisam-storage-engine.html "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") and other kinds of tables.

See Also [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup), [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb).

### B

B-tree

A tree data structure that is popular for use in database
indexes. The structure is kept sorted at all times, enabling
fast lookup for exact matches (equals operator) and ranges (for
example, greater than, less than, and `BETWEEN`
operators). This type of index is available for most storage
engines, such as [`InnoDB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") and
[`MyISAM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/myisam-storage-engine.html "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine").


Because B-tree nodes can have many children, a B-tree is not the
same as a binary tree, which is limited to 2 children per node.


Contrast with **hash index**, which
is only available in the [`MEMORY`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/memory-storage-engine.html "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine")
storage engine. The `MEMORY` storage engine can
also use B-tree indexes, and you should choose B-tree indexes
for `MEMORY` tables if some queries use range
operators.


The use of the term B-tree is intended as a reference to the
general class of index design. B-tree structures used by MySQL
storage engines may be regarded as variants due to
sophistications not present in a classic B-tree design. For
related information, refer to the `InnoDB` Page
Structure
[Fil\\
Header](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/innodb-fil-header.html) section of the
[MySQL\\
Internals Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/index.html).


See Also [hash index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hash_index).

backticks

Identifiers within MySQL SQL statements must be quoted using the
backtick character ( `` ` ``) if they contain
special characters or reserved words. For example, to refer to a
table named `FOO#BAR` or a column named
`SELECT`, you would specify the identifiers as
`` `FOO#BAR` `` and `` `SELECT` ``.
Since the backticks provide an extra level of safety, they are
used extensively in program-generated SQL statements, where the
identifier names might not be known in advance.


Many other database systems use double quotation marks
( `"`) around such special names. For
portability, you can enable `ANSI_QUOTES` mode
in MySQL and use double quotation marks instead of backticks to
qualify identifier names.


See Also [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sql).

backup

The process of copying some or all table data and metadata from
a MySQL instance, for safekeeping. Can also refer to the set of
copied files. This is a crucial task for DBAs. The reverse of
this process is the **restore**
operation.


With MySQL, **physical backups**
are performed by the **MySQL Enterprise Backup**
product, and **logical backups**
are performed by the `mysqldump` command. These
techniques have different characteristics in terms of size and
representation of the backup data, and speed (especially speed
of the restore operation).


Backups are further classified as
**hot**,
**warm**, or
**cold** depending on how much they
interfere with normal database operation. (Hot backups have the
least interference, cold backups the most.)


See Also [cold backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cold_backup), [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup), [logical backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_logical_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqldump](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqldump), [physical backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_physical_backup), [warm backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_warm_backup).

base column

A non-generated table column upon which a stored generated
column or virtual generated column is based. In other words, a
base column is a non-generated table column that is part of a
generated column definition.


See Also [generated column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_generated_column), [stored generated column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_stored_generated_column), [virtual generated column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_virtual_generated_column).

beta

An early stage in the life of a software product, when it is
available only for evaluation, typically without a definite
release number or a number less than 1.
`InnoDB` does not use the beta designation,
preferring an **early adopter**
phase that can extend over several point releases, leading to a
**GA** release.


See Also [early adopter](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_early_adopter), [GA](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ga).

binary log

A file containing a record of all statements or row changes that
attempt to change table data. The contents of the binary log can
be replayed to bring replicas up to date in a
**replication** scenario, or to
bring a database up to date after restoring table data from a
backup. The binary logging feature can be turned on and off,
although Oracle recommends always enabling it if you use
replication or perform backups.


You can examine the contents of the binary log, or replay it
during replication or recovery, by using the
[**mysqlbinlog**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqlbinlog.html "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") command. For full information
about the binary log, see [Section 7.4.4, “The Binary Log”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/binary-log.html "7.4.4 The Binary Log"). For
MySQL configuration options related to the binary log, see
[Section 19.1.6.4, “Binary Logging Options and Variables”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html "19.1.6.4 Binary Logging Options and Variables").


For the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, the file
name of the binary log and the current position within the file
are important details. To record this information for the source
when taking a backup in a replication context, you can specify
the `--slave-info` option.


Prior to MySQL 5.0, a similar capability was available, known as
the update log. In MySQL 5.0 and higher, the binary log replaces
the update log.


See Also [binlog](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_binlog), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replication).

binlog

An informal name for the **binary**
**log** file. For example, you might see this
abbreviation used in e-mail messages or forum discussions.


See Also [binary log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_binary_log).

blind query expansion

A special mode of **full-text**
**search** enabled by the `WITH QUERY
        EXPANSION` clause. It performs the search twice, where
the search phrase for the second search is the original search
phrase concatenated with the few most highly relevant documents
from the first search. This technique is mainly applicable for
short search phrases, perhaps only a single word. It can uncover
relevant matches where the precise search term does not occur in
the document.


See Also [full-text search](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_full_text_search).

BLOB

An SQL data type ( [`TINYBLOB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
[`BLOB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
[`MEDIUMBLOB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), and
[`LONGBLOB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")) for objects containing
any kind of binary data, of arbitrary size. Used for storing
documents, images, sound files, and other kinds of information
that cannot easily be decomposed to rows and columns within a
MySQL table. The techniques for handling BLOBs within a MySQL
application vary with each
**Connector** and
**API**. MySQL
`Connector/ODBC` defines
`BLOB` values as
`LONGVARBINARY`. For large, free-form
collections of character data, the industry term is
**CLOB**, represented by the MySQL
`TEXT` data types.


See Also [API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_api), [CLOB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_clob), [connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector), [Connector/ODBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_odbc).

bottleneck

A portion of a system that is constrained in size or capacity,
that has the effect of limiting overall throughput. For example,
a memory area might be smaller than necessary; access to a
single required resource might prevent multiple CPU cores from
running simultaneously; or waiting for disk I/O to complete
might prevent the CPU from running at full capacity. Removing
bottlenecks tends to improve
**concurrency**. For example, the
ability to have multiple `InnoDB` **buffer pool** instances reduces
contention when multiple sessions read from and write to the
buffer pool simultaneously.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [concurrency](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_concurrency).

bounce

A **shutdown** operation
immediately followed by a restart. Ideally with a relatively
short **warmup** period so that
performance and throughput quickly return to a high level.


See Also [shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_shutdown).

buddy allocator

A mechanism for managing different-sized
**pages** in the InnoDB
**buffer pool**.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page), [page size](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page_size).

buffer

A memory or disk area used for temporary storage. Data is
buffered in memory so that it can be written to disk
efficiently, with a few large I/O operations rather than many
small ones. Data is buffered on disk for greater reliability, so
that it can be recovered even when a
**crash** or other failure occurs
at the worst possible time. The main types of buffers used by
InnoDB are the **buffer pool**, the
**doublewrite buffer**, and the
**change buffer**.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [change buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffer), [crash](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_crash), [doublewrite buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_doublewrite_buffer).

buffer pool

The memory area that holds cached `InnoDB` data
for both tables and indexes. For efficiency of high-volume read
operations, the buffer pool is divided into
**pages** that can potentially hold
multiple rows. For efficiency of cache management, the buffer
pool is implemented as a linked list of pages; data that is
rarely used is aged out of the cache, using a variation of the
**LRU** algorithm. On systems with
large memory, you can improve concurrency by dividing the buffer
pool into multiple **buffer pool**
**instances**.


Several `InnoDB` status variables,
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables, and
`performance_schema` tables help to monitor the
internal workings of the buffer pool. Starting in MySQL 5.6, you
can avoid a lengthy warmup period after restarting the server,
particularly for instances with large buffer pools, by saving
the buffer pool state at server shutdown and restoring the
buffer pool to the same state at server startup. See
[Section 17.8.3.6, “Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-preload-buffer-pool.html "17.8.3.6 Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State").


See Also [buffer pool instance](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool_instance), [LRU](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lru), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page), [warm up](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_warm_up).

buffer pool instance

Any of the multiple regions into which the
**buffer pool** can be divided,
controlled by the
[`innodb_buffer_pool_instances`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_instances)
configuration option. The total memory size specified by
[`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size) is
divided among all buffer pool instances. Typically, having
multiple buffer pool instances is appropriate for systems that
allocate multiple gigabytes to the `InnoDB`
buffer pool, with each instance being one gigabyte or larger. On
systems loading or looking up large amounts of data in the
buffer pool from many concurrent sessions, having multiple
buffer pool instances reduces contention for exclusive access to
data structures that manage the buffer pool.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool).

built-in

The built-in `InnoDB` storage engine within
MySQL is the original form of distribution for the storage
engine. Contrast with the **InnoDB**
**Plugin**. Starting with MySQL 5.5, the InnoDB Plugin is
merged back into the MySQL code base as the built-in
`InnoDB` storage engine (known as InnoDB 1.1).


This distinction is important mainly in MySQL 5.1, where a
feature or bug fix might apply to the InnoDB Plugin but not the
built-in `InnoDB`, or vice versa.


See Also [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb).

business rules

The relationships and sequences of actions that form the basis
of business software, used to run a commercial company.
Sometimes these rules are dictated by law, other times by
company policy. Careful planning ensures that the relationships
encoded and enforced by the database, and the actions performed
through application logic, accurately reflect the real policies
of the company and can handle real-life situations.


For example, an employee leaving a company might trigger a
sequence of actions from the human resources department. The
human resources database might also need the flexibility to
represent data about a person who has been hired, but not yet
started work. Closing an account at an online service might
result in data being removed from a database, or the data might
be moved or flagged so that it could be recovered if the account
is re-opened. A company might establish policies regarding
salary maximums, minimums, and adjustments, in addition to basic
sanity checks such as the salary not being a negative number. A
retail database might not allow a purchase with the same serial
number to be returned more than once, or might not allow credit
card purchases above a certain value, while a database used to
detect fraud might allow these kinds of things.

See Also [relational](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_relational).

### C

.cfg file

A metadata file used with the `InnoDB` **transportable tablespace**
feature. It is produced by the command `FLUSH TABLES ...
        FOR EXPORT`, puts one or more tables in a consistent
state that can be copied to another server. The
`.cfg` file is copied along with the
corresponding **.ibd file**, and
used to adjust the internal values of the
`.ibd` file, such as the
**space ID**, during the
`ALTER TABLE ... IMPORT TABLESPACE` step.


See Also [.ibd file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ibd_file), [space ID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_space_id), [transportable tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transportable_tablespace).

C

A programming language that combines portability with
performance and access to low-level hardware features, making it
a popular choice for writing operating systems, drivers, and
other kinds of system software. Many complex applications,
languages, and reusable modules feature pieces written in C,
tied together with high-level components written in other
languages. Its core syntax is familiar to
**C++**,
**Java**, and
**C#** developers.


See Also [C API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_c_api), [C++](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cplusplus), [C#](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_csharp), [Java](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_java).

C API

The C **API** code is distributed
with MySQL. It is included in the
**libmysqlclient** library and
enables **C** programs to access a
database.


See Also [API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_api), [C](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_c), [libmysqlclient](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_libmysqlclient).

C#

A programming language combining strong typing and
object-oriented features, running within the Microsoft
**.NET** framework or its
open-source counterpart **Mono**.
Often used for creating applications with the
**ASP.net** framework. Its syntax
is familiar to **C**,
**C++** and
**Java** developers.


See Also [.NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos__net), [ASP.net](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_asp_net), [C](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_c), [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_net), [C++](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cplusplus), [Java](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_java), [Mono](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mono).

C++

A programming language with core syntax familiar to
**C** developers. Provides access
to low-level operations for performance, combined with
higher-level data types, object-oriented features, and garbage
collection. To write C++ applications for MySQL, you use the
**Connector/C++** component.


See Also [C](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_c), [Connector/C++](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_c__).

cache

The general term for any memory area that stores copies of data
for frequent or high-speed retrieval. In
`InnoDB`, the primary kind of cache structure
is the **buffer pool**.


See Also [buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer), [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool).

cardinality

The number of different values in a table
**column**. When queries refer to
columns that have an associated
**index**, the cardinality of each
column influences which access method is most efficient. For
example, for a column with a **unique**
**constraint**, the number of different values is equal
to the number of rows in the table. If a table has a million
rows but only 10 different values for a particular column, each
value occurs (on average) 100,000 times. A query such as
`SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 50;` thus might
return 1 row or a huge number of rows, and the database server
might process the query differently depending on the cardinality
of `c1`.


If the values in a column have a very uneven distribution, the
cardinality might not be a good way to determine the best query
plan. For example, `SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE c1 =
        x;` might return 1 row when `x=50` and
a million rows when `x=30`. In such a case, you
might need to use **index hints**
to pass along advice about which lookup method is more efficient
for a particular query.


Cardinality can also apply to the number of distinct values
present in multiple columns, as in a
**composite index**.


See Also [column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_column), [composite index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_composite_index), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [index hint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index_hint), [persistent statistics](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_persistent_statistics), [random dive](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_random_dive), [selectivity](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_selectivity), [unique constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_unique_constraint).

change buffer

A special data structure that records changes to
**pages** in
**secondary indexes**. These values
could result from SQL [`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), or
[`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements
(**DML**). The set of features
involving the change buffer is known collectively as
**change buffering**, consisting of
**insert buffering**,
**delete buffering**, and
**purge buffering**.


Changes are only recorded in the change buffer when the relevant
page from the secondary index is not in the
**buffer pool**. When the relevant
index page is brought into the buffer pool while associated
changes are still in the change buffer, the changes for that
page are applied in the buffer pool
(**merged**) using the data from
the change buffer. Periodically, the
**purge** operation that runs
during times when the system is mostly idle, or during a slow
shutdown, writes the new index pages to disk. The purge
operation can write the disk blocks for a series of index values
more efficiently than if each value were written to disk
immediately.


Physically, the change buffer is part of the
**system tablespace**, so that the
index changes remain buffered across database restarts. The
changes are only applied
(**merged**) when the pages are
brought into the buffer pool due to some other read operation.


The kinds and amount of data stored in the change buffer are
governed by the
[`innodb_change_buffering`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_change_buffering) and
[`innodb_change_buffer_max_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_change_buffer_max_size)
configuration options. To see information about the current data
in the change buffer, issue the
[`SHOW ENGINE INNODB\\
        STATUS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-engine.html "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") command.


Formerly known as the **insert**
**buffer**.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [change buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffering), [delete buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_delete_buffering), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [insert buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_insert_buffer), [insert buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_insert_buffering), [merge](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_merge), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page), [purge](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_purge), [purge buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_purge_buffering), [secondary index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_secondary_index), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace).

change buffering

The general term for the features involving the
**change buffer**, consisting of
**insert buffering**,
**delete buffering**, and
**purge buffering**. Index changes
resulting from SQL statements, which could normally involve
random I/O operations, are held back and performed periodically
by a background **thread**. This
sequence of operations can write the disk blocks for a series of
index values more efficiently than if each value were written to
disk immediately. Controlled by the
[`innodb_change_buffering`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_change_buffering) and
[`innodb_change_buffer_max_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_change_buffer_max_size)
configuration options.


See Also [change buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffer), [delete buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_delete_buffering), [insert buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_insert_buffering), [purge buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_purge_buffering).

checkpoint

As changes are made to data pages that are cached in the
**buffer pool**, those changes are
written to the **data files**
sometime later, a process known as
**flushing**. The checkpoint is a
record of the latest changes (represented by an
**LSN** value) that have been
successfully written to the data files.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [fuzzy checkpointing](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fuzzy_checkpointing), [LSN](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lsn).

checksum

In `InnoDB`, a validation mechanism to detect
corruption when a **page** in a
**tablespace** is read from disk
into the `InnoDB` **buffer**
**pool**. This feature is controlled by the
`innodb_checksums` configuration option in
MySQL 5.5. `innodb_checksums` is deprecated in
MySQL 5.6.3, replaced by
[`innodb_checksum_algorithm`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_checksum_algorithm).


The [**innochecksum**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innochecksum.html "6.6.2 innochecksum — Offline InnoDB File Checksum Utility") command helps diagnose
corruption problems by testing the checksum values for a
specified **tablespace** file while
the MySQL server is shut down.


MySQL also uses checksums for replication purposes. For details,
see the configuration options
[`binlog_checksum`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_checksum),
[`source_verify_checksum`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_source_verify_checksum) or
[`master_verify_checksum`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_master_verify_checksum), and

child table

In a **foreign key** relationship,
a child table is one whose rows refer (or point) to rows in
another table with an identical value for a specific column.
This is the table that contains the `FOREIGN KEY ...
        REFERENCES` clause and optionally `ON
        UPDATE` and `ON DELETE` clauses. The
corresponding row in the **parent**
**table** must exist before the row can be created in the
child table. The values in the child table can prevent delete or
update operations on the parent table, or can cause automatic
deletion or updates in the child table, based on the `ON
        CASCADE` option used when creating the foreign key.


See Also [foreign key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_foreign_key), [parent table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_parent_table).

clean page

A **page** in the
`InnoDB` **buffer**
**pool** where all changes made in memory have also been
written (**flushed**) to the
[data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files "data files"). The opposite
of a **dirty page**.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files), [dirty page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dirty_page), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page).

clean shutdown

A **shutdown** that completes
without errors and applies all changes to
`InnoDB` tables before finishing, as opposed to
a **crash** or a
**fast shutdown**. Synonym for
**slow shutdown**.


See Also [crash](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_crash), [fast shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fast_shutdown), [shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_shutdown), [slow shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_slow_shutdown).

client

A program that runs outside the database server, communicating
with the database by sending requests through a
**Connector**, or an
**API** made available through
**client libraries**. It can run on
the same physical machine as the database server, or on a remote
machine connected over a network. It can be a special-purpose
database application, or a general-purpose program like the
[**mysql**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") command-line processor.


See Also [API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_api), [client libraries](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_client_libraries), [connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector), [mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql), [server](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_server).

client libraries

Files containing collections of functions for working with
databases. By compiling your program with these libraries, or
installing them on the same system as your application, you can
run a database application (known as a
**client**) on a machine that does
not have the MySQL server installed; the application accesses
the database over a network. With MySQL, you can use the
**libmysqlclient** library from the
MySQL server itself.


See Also [client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_client), [libmysqlclient](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_libmysqlclient).

client-side prepared statement

A type of **prepared statement**
where the caching and reuse are managed locally, emulating the
functionality of **server-side prepared**
**statements**. Historically, used by some
**Connector/J**,
**Connector/ODBC**, and
**Connector/PHP** developers to
work around issues with server-side stored procedures. With
modern MySQL server versions, server-side prepared statements
are recommended for performance, scalability, and memory
efficiency.


See Also [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [Connector/ODBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_odbc), [Connector/PHP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_php), [prepared statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_prepared_statement).

CLOB

An SQL data type ( [`TINYTEXT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
[`TEXT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
[`MEDIUMTEXT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), or
[`LONGTEXT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")) for objects containing
any kind of character data, of arbitrary size. Used for storing
text-based documents, with associated character set and
collation order. The techniques for handling CLOBs within a
MySQL application vary with each
**Connector** and
**API**. MySQL Connector/ODBC
defines `TEXT` values as
`LONGVARCHAR`. For storing binary data, the
equivalent is the **BLOB** type.


See Also [API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_api), [BLOB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_blob), [connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector), [Connector/ODBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_odbc).

clustered index

The `InnoDB` term for a
**primary key** index.
`InnoDB` table storage is organized based on
the values of the primary key columns, to speed up queries and
sorts involving the primary key columns. For best performance,
choose the primary key columns carefully based on the most
performance-critical queries. Because modifying the columns of
the clustered index is an expensive operation, choose primary
columns that are rarely or never updated.


In the Oracle Database product, this type of table is known as
an **index-organized table**.


See Also [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [primary key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_primary_key), [secondary index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_secondary_index).

cold backup

A **backup** taken while the
database is shut down. For busy applications and websites, this
might not be practical, and you might prefer a
**warm backup** or a
**hot backup**.


See Also [backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_backup), [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup), [warm backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_warm_backup).

column

A data item within a **row**, whose
storage and semantics are defined by a data type. Each
**table** and
**index** is largely defined by the
set of columns it contains.


Each column has a **cardinality**
value. A column can be the **primary**
**key** for its table, or part of the primary key. A
column can be subject to a **unique**
**constraint**, a **NOT NULL**
**constraint**, or both. Values in different columns,
even across different tables, can be linked by a
**foreign key** relationship.


In discussions of MySQL internal operations, sometimes
**field** is used as a synonym.


See Also [cardinality](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cardinality), [foreign key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_foreign_key), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [NOT NULL constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_not_null_constraint), [primary key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_primary_key), [row](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table), [unique constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_unique_constraint).

column index

An **index** on a single column.


See Also [composite index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_composite_index), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index).

column prefix

When an **index** is created with a
length specification, such as `CREATE INDEX idx ON t1
        (c1(N))`, only the first N characters of the column
value are stored in the index. Keeping the index prefix small
makes the index compact, and the memory and disk I/O savings
help performance. (Although making the index prefix too small
can hinder query optimization by making rows with different
values appear to the query optimizer to be duplicates.)


For columns containing binary values or long text strings, where
sorting is not a major consideration and storing the entire
value in the index would waste space, the index automatically
uses the first N (typically 768) characters of the value to do
lookups and sorts.


See Also [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index).

command interceptor

Synonym for **statement**
**interceptor**. One aspect of the
**interceptor** design pattern
available for both **Connector/NET** and
**Connector/J**. What Connector/NET calls
a command, Connector/J refers to as a statement. Contrast with
**exception interceptor**.


See Also [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_net), [exception interceptor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_exception_interceptor), [interceptor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_interceptor), [statement interceptor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_statement_interceptor).

commit

A **SQL** statement that ends a
**transaction**, making permanent
any changes made by the transaction. It is the opposite of
**rollback**, which undoes any
changes made in the transaction.


`InnoDB` uses an
**optimistic** mechanism for
commits, so that changes can be written to the data files before
the commit actually occurs. This technique makes the commit
itself faster, with the tradeoff that more work is required in
case of a rollback.


By default, MySQL uses the
**autocommit** setting, which
automatically issues a commit following each SQL statement.


See Also [autocommit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_autocommit), [optimistic](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_optimistic), [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback), [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sql), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

compact row format

A **row format** for InnoDB tables.
It was the default row format from MySQL 5.0.3 to MySQL 5.7.8.
In MySQL 8.0, the default row format is defined by the
[`innodb_default_row_format`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
configuration option, which has a default setting of
**DYNAMIC**. The
**COMPACT** row format provides a
more compact representation for nulls and variable-length
columns than the **REDUNDANT** row
format.


For additional information about `InnoDB` `COMPACT` row format, see
[Section 17.10, “InnoDB Row Formats”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-row-format.html "17.10 InnoDB Row Formats").


See Also [dynamic row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dynamic_row_format), [file format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_format), [redundant row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redundant_row_format), [row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_format).

composite index

An **index** that includes multiple
columns.


See Also [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index).

compressed backup

The compression feature of the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product makes a
compressed copy of each tablespace, changing the extension from
`.ibd` to `.ibz`. Compressing
backup data allows you to keep more backups on hand, and reduces
the time to transfer backups to a different server. The data is
uncompressed during the restore operation. When a compressed
backup operation processes a table that is already compressed,
it skips the compression step for that table, because
compressing again would result in little or no space savings.


A set of files produced by the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, where each
**tablespace** is compressed. The
compressed files are renamed with a `.ibz` file
extension.


Applying **compression** at the
start of the backup process helps to avoid storage overhead
during the compression process, and to avoid network overhead
when transferring the backup files to another server. The
process of **applying** the
**binary log** takes longer, and
requires uncompressing the backup files.


See Also [apply](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_apply), [binary log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_binary_log), [compression](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compression), [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_tablespace).

compressed row format

A **row format** that enables data
and index **compression** for
`InnoDB` tables. Large fields are stored away
from the page that holds the rest of the row data, as in
**dynamic row format**. Both index
pages and the large fields are compressed, yielding memory and
disk savings. Depending on the structure of the data, the
decrease in memory and disk usage might or might not outweigh
the performance overhead of uncompressing the data as it is
used. See [Section 17.9, “InnoDB Table and Page Compression”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-compression.html "17.9 InnoDB Table and Page Compression") for usage
details.


For additional information about `InnoDB` `COMPRESSED` row format, see
[DYNAMIC Row Format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-row-format.html#innodb-row-format-dynamic "DYNAMIC Row Format").


See Also [compression](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compression), [dynamic row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dynamic_row_format), [row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_format).

compressed table

A table for which the data is stored in compressed form. For
`InnoDB`, it is a table created with
`ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`. See
[Section 17.9, “InnoDB Table and Page Compression”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-compression.html "17.9 InnoDB Table and Page Compression") for more information.


See Also [compressed row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compressed_row_format), [compression](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compression).

compression

A feature with wide-ranging benefits from using less disk space,
performing less I/O, and using less memory for caching.


`InnoDB` supports both table-level and
page-level compression. `InnoDB` page
compression is also referred to as
**transparent page compression**.
For more information about `InnoDB`
compression, see [Section 17.9, “InnoDB Table and Page Compression”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-compression.html "17.9 InnoDB Table and Page Compression").


Another type of compression is the
**compressed backup** feature of
the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [compressed backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compressed_backup), [compressed row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compressed_row_format), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [transparent page compression](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transparent_page_compression).

compression failure

Not actually an error, rather an expensive operation that can
occur when using **compression** in
combination with **DML**
operations. It occurs when: updates to a compressed
**page** overflow the area on the
page reserved for recording modifications; the page is
compressed again, with all changes applied to the table data;
the re-compressed data does not fit on the original page,
requiring MySQL to split the data into two new pages and
compress each one separately. To check the frequency of this
condition, query the
[`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_CMP`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-innodb-cmp-table.html "28.4.6 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_CMP and INNODB_CMP_RESET Tables") table
and check how much the value of the
`COMPRESS_OPS` column exceeds the value of the
`COMPRESS_OPS_OK` column. Ideally, compression
failures do not occur often; when they do, you can adjust the
[`innodb_compression_level`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_compression_level),
[`innodb_compression_failure_threshold_pct`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_compression_failure_threshold_pct),
and
[`innodb_compression_pad_pct_max`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_compression_pad_pct_max)
configuration options.


See Also [compression](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compression), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page).

concatenated index

See [composite index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_composite_index).

concurrency

The ability of multiple operations (in database terminology,
**transactions**) to run
simultaneously, without interfering with each other. Concurrency
is also involved with performance, because ideally the
protection for multiple simultaneous transactions works with a
minimum of performance overhead, using efficient mechanisms for
**locking**.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

configuration file

The file that holds the **option**
values used by MySQL at startup. Traditionally, on Linux and
Unix this file is named `my.cnf`, and on
Windows it is named `my.ini`. You can set a
number of options related to InnoDB under the
`[mysqld]` section of the file.


See [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/option-files.html "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files") for information about where
MySQL searches for configuration files.


When you use the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product,
you typically use two configuration files: one that specifies
where the data comes from and how it is structured (which could
be the original configuration file for your server), and a
stripped-down one containing only a small set of options that
specify where the backup data goes and how it is structured. The
configuration files used with the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product must contain
certain options that are typically left out of regular
configuration files, so you might need to add options to your
existing configuration file for use with
**MySQL Enterprise Backup**.


See Also [my.cnf](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_my_cnf), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [option](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_option), [option file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_option_file).

connection

The communication channel between an application and a MySQL
server. The performance and scalability of a database
applications is influenced by on how quickly a database
connection can be established, how many can be made
simultaneously, and how long they persist. The parameters such
as **host**,
**port**, and so on are represented
as a **connection string** in
**Connector/NET**, and as a
**DSN** in
**Connector/ODBC**. High-traffic
systems make use of an optimization known as the
**connection pool**.


See Also [connection pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connection_pool), [connection string](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connection_string), [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_net), [Connector/ODBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_odbc), [DSN](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dsn), [host](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_host), [port](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_port).

connection pool

A cache area that allows database
**connections** to be reused within
the same application or across different applications, rather
than setting up and tearing down a new connection for every
database operation. This technique is common with
**J2EE** application servers.
**Java** applications using
**Connector/J** can use the
connection pool features of
**Tomcat** and other application
servers. The reuse is transparent to applications; the
application still opens and closes the connection as usual.


See Also [connection](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connection), [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [J2EE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_j2ee), [Tomcat](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_tomcat).

connection string

A representation of the parameters for a database
**connection**, encoded as a string
literal so that it can be used in program code. The parts of the
string represent connection parameters such as
**host** and
**port**. A connection string
contains several key-value pairs, separated by semicolons. Each
key-value pair is joined with an equal sign. Frequently used
with **Connector/NET** applications; see
[Creating a Connector/NET Connection String](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-connections-string.html) for details.


See Also [connection](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connection), [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_net), [host](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_host), [port](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_port).

connector

MySQL Connectors provide connectivity to the MySQL server for
**client** programs. Several
programming languages and frameworks each have their own

Connector/C++

Connector/C++ 8.0 can be used to access MySQL servers that implement a
[document store](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/document-store.html "Chapter 22 Using MySQL as a Document Store"), or in a
traditional way using SQL queries. It enables development of C++
applications using X DevAPI, or plain C applications using
X DevAPI for C. It also enables development of C++ applications that
use the legacy JDBC-based API from Connector/C++ 1.1. For more
information, see [MySQL Connector/C++ 9.4 Developer Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-cpp/9.4/en/).

Connector/J

A **JDBC** driver that provides
connectivity for **client**
applications developed in the
**Java** programming language.
MySQL Connector/J is a JDBC Type 4 driver: a pure-Java
implementation of the MySQL protocol that does not rely on the
MySQL **client libraries**. For
full details, see [MySQL Connector/J Developer Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/).


See Also [client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_client), [client libraries](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_client_libraries), [connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector), [Java](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_java), [JDBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_jdbc).

Connector/NET

A MySQL **connector** for
developers writing applications using languages, technologies,
and frameworks such as **C#**,
**.NET**,
**Mono**,
**Visual Studio**,
**ASP.net**, and
**ADO.net**.


See Also [ADO.NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ado_net), [ASP.net](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_asp_net), [connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector), [C#](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_csharp), [Mono](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mono), [Visual Studio](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_visual_studio).

Connector/ODBC

The family of MySQL ODBC drivers that provide access to a MySQL
database using the industry standard Open Database Connectivity
(**ODBC**) API. Formerly called
MyODBC drivers. For full details, see
[MySQL Connector/ODBC Developer Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/).


See Also [connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector), [ODBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_odbc).

Connector/PHP

A version of the `mysql` and
`mysqli` **APIs**
for **PHP** optimized for the
Windows operating system.


See Also [connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector), [PHP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_php), [PHP API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_php_api).

consistent read

A read operation that uses
**snapshot** information to present
query results based on a point in time, regardless of changes
performed by other transactions running at the same time. If
queried data has been changed by another transaction, the
original data is reconstructed based on the contents of the
**undo log**. This technique avoids
some of the **locking** issues that
can reduce **concurrency** by
forcing transactions to wait for other transactions to finish.


With **REPEATABLE READ****isolation level**, the snapshot
is based on the time when the first read operation is performed.
With **READ COMMITTED** isolation
level, the snapshot is reset to the time of each consistent read
operation.


Consistent read is the default mode in which
`InnoDB` processes `SELECT`
statements in **READ COMMITTED**
and **REPEATABLE READ** isolation
levels. Because a consistent read does not set any locks on the
tables it accesses, other sessions are free to modify those
tables while a consistent read is being performed on the table.


For technical details about the applicable isolation levels, see
[Section 17.7.2.3, “Consistent Nonlocking Reads”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-consistent-read.html "17.7.2.3 Consistent Nonlocking Reads").


See Also [concurrency](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_concurrency), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [READ COMMITTED](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_committed), [REPEATABLE READ](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_repeatable_read), [snapshot](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_snapshot), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction), [undo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log).

constraint

An automatic test that can block database changes to prevent
data from becoming inconsistent. (In computer science terms, a
kind of assertion related to an invariant condition.)
Constraints are a crucial component of the
**ACID** philosophy, to maintain
data consistency. Constraints supported by MySQL include
**FOREIGN KEY constraints** and
**unique constraints**.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [foreign key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_foreign_key), [unique constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_unique_constraint).

counter

A value that is incremented by a particular kind of
`InnoDB` operation. Useful for measuring how
busy a server is, troubleshooting the sources of performance
issues, and testing whether changes (for example, to
configuration settings or indexes used by queries) have the
desired low-level effects. Different kinds of counters are
available through **Performance**
**Schema** tables and
**INFORMATION\_SCHEMA** tables,
particularly
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_METRICS`.


See Also [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_information_schema), [metrics counter](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_metrics_counter), [Performance Schema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_performance_schema).

covering index

An **index** that includes all the
columns retrieved by a query. Instead of using the index values
as pointers to find the full table rows, the query returns
values from the index structure, saving disk I/O.
`InnoDB` can apply this optimization technique
to more indexes than MyISAM can, because
`InnoDB` **secondary**
**indexes** also include the
**primary key** columns.
`InnoDB` cannot apply this technique for
queries against tables modified by a transaction, until that
transaction ends.


Any **column index** or
**composite index** could act as a
covering index, given the right query. Design your indexes and
queries to take advantage of this optimization technique
wherever possible.


See Also [column index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_column_index), [composite index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_composite_index), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [primary key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_primary_key), [secondary index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_secondary_index).

CPU-bound

A type of **workload** where the
primary **bottleneck** is CPU
operations in memory. Typically involves read-intensive
operations where the results can all be cached in the
**buffer pool**.


See Also [bottleneck](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_bottleneck), [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [workload](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_workload).

crash

MySQL uses the term “crash” to refer generally to
any unexpected **shutdown**
operation where the server cannot do its normal cleanup. For
example, a crash could happen due to a hardware fault on the
database server machine or storage device; a power failure; a
potential data mismatch that causes the MySQL server to halt; a
**fast shutdown** initiated by the
DBA; or many other reasons. The robust, automatic
**crash recovery** for
**InnoDB** tables ensures that data
is made consistent when the server is restarted, without any
extra work for the DBA.


See Also [crash recovery](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_crash_recovery), [fast shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fast_shutdown), [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb), [shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_shutdown).

crash recovery

The cleanup activities that occur when MySQL is started again
after a **crash**. For
**InnoDB** tables, changes from
incomplete transactions are replayed using data from the
**redo log**. Changes that were
**committed** before the crash, but
not yet written into the **data**
**files**, are reconstructed from the
**doublewrite buffer**. When the
database is shut down normally, this type of activity is
performed during shutdown by the
**purge** operation.


During normal operation, committed data can be stored in the
**change buffer** for a period of
time before being written to the data files. There is always a
tradeoff between keeping the data files up-to-date, which
introduces performance overhead during normal operation, and
buffering the data, which can make shutdown and crash recovery
take longer.


See Also [change buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffer), [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [crash](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_crash), [data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files), [doublewrite buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_doublewrite_buffer), [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb), [purge](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_purge), [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log).

CRUD

Acronym for “create, read, update, delete”, a
common sequence of operations in database applications. Often
denotes a class of applications with relatively simple database
usage (basic **DDL**,
**DML** and
**query** statements in
**SQL**) that can be implemented
quickly in any language.


See Also [DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ddl), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query), [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sql).

cursor

An internal MySQL data structure that represents the result set
of an SQL statement. Often used with
**prepared statements** and
**dynamic SQL**. It works like an
iterator in other high-level languages, producing each value
from the result set as requested.


Although SQL usually handles the processing of cursors for you,
you might delve into the inner workings when dealing with
performance-critical code.

See Also [dynamic SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dynamic_sql), [prepared statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_prepared_statement), [query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query).

### D

data definition language

See [DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ddl).

data dictionary

Metadata that keeps track of database objects such as
**tables**,
**indexes**, and table
**columns**. For the MySQL data
dictionary, introduced in MySQL 8.0, metadata is physically
located in `InnoDB` **file-per-table** tablespace files
in the `mysql` database directory. For the
`InnoDB` data dictionary, metadata is
physically located in the `InnoDB` **system tablespace**.


Because the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product
always backs up the `InnoDB` system tablespace,
all backups include the contents of the
`InnoDB` data dictionary.


See Also [column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_column), [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [.frm file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_frm_file), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table).

data directory

The directory under which each MySQL
**instance** keeps the
**data files** for
`InnoDB` and the directories representing
individual databases. Controlled by the
[`datadir`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_datadir) configuration option.


See Also [data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files), [instance](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_instance).

data files

The files that physically contain
**table** and
**index** data.


The `InnoDB` **system**
**tablespace**, which holds the `InnoDB` **data dictionary** and is capable
of holding data for multiple `InnoDB` tables,
is represented by one or more `.ibdata` data
files.


File-per-table tablespaces, which hold data for a single
`InnoDB` table, are represented by a
`.ibd` data file.


General tablespaces (introduced in MySQL 5.7.6), which can hold
data for multiple `InnoDB` tables, are also
represented by a `.ibd` data file.


See Also [data dictionary](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_dictionary), [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [general tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_general_tablespace), [.ibd file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ibd_file), [ibdata file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ibdata_file), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table), [tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_tablespace).

data manipulation language

See [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml).

data warehouse

A database system or application that primarily runs large
**queries**. The read-only or
read-mostly data might be organized in
**denormalized** form for query
efficiency. Can benefit from the optimizations for
**read-only transactions** in MySQL
5.6 and higher. Contrast with
**OLTP**.


See Also [denormalized](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_denormalized), [OLTP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_oltp), [query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query), [read-only transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_only_transaction).

database

Within the MySQL **data**
**directory**, each database is represented by a separate
directory. The InnoDB **system**
**tablespace**, which can hold table data from multiple
databases within a MySQL
**instance**, is kept in
**data files** that reside outside
of individual database directories. When
**file-per-table** mode is enabled,
the **.ibd files** representing
individual InnoDB tables are stored inside the database
directories unless created elsewhere using the `DATA
        DIRECTORY` clause. General tablespaces, introduced in
MySQL 5.7.6, also hold table data in **.ibd**
**files**. Unlike file-per-table
**.ibd files**, general tablespace
**.ibd files** can hold table data
from multiple databases within a MySQL
**instance**, and can be assigned
to directories relative to or independent of the MySQL data
directory.


For long-time MySQL users, a database is a familiar notion.
Users coming from an Oracle Database background may find that
the MySQL meaning of a database is closer to what Oracle
Database calls a **schema**.


See Also [data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files), [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [.ibd file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ibd_file), [instance](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_instance), [schema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_schema), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace).

DCL

Data control language, a set of
**SQL** statements for managing
privileges. In MySQL, consists of the
[`GRANT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/grant.html "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") and
[`REVOKE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/revoke.html "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") statements. Contrast with
**DDL** and
**DML**.


See Also [DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ddl), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sql).

DDEX provider

A feature that lets you use the data design tools within
**Visual Studio** to manipulate the
schema and objects within a MySQL database. For MySQL
applications using **Connector/NET**, the
MySQL Visual Studio Plugin acts as a DDEX provider with MySQL
5.0 and later.


See Also [Visual Studio](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_visual_studio).

DDL

Data definition language, a set of
**SQL** statements for manipulating
the database itself rather than individual table rows. Includes
all forms of the `CREATE`,
`ALTER`, and `DROP`
statements. Also includes the `TRUNCATE`
statement, because it works differently than a `DELETE
        FROM table_name` statement,
even though the ultimate effect is similar.


DDL statements automatically
**commit** the current
**transaction**; they cannot be
**rolled back**.


The `InnoDB` [online DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_online_ddl "online DDL") feature
enhances performance for [`CREATE\\
        INDEX`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-index.html "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement"), [`DROP INDEX`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-index.html "15.1.27 DROP INDEX Statement"), and
many types of [`ALTER TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
operations. See [Section 17.12, “InnoDB and Online DDL”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-online-ddl.html "17.12 InnoDB and Online DDL") for more
information. Also, the `InnoDB` [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table "file-per-table")
setting can affect the behavior of [`DROP\\
        TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-table.html "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") and [`TRUNCATE\\
        TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/truncate-table.html "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") operations.


Contrast with **DML** and
**DCL**.


See Also [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [DCL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dcl), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback), [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sql), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

deadlock

A situation where different
**transactions** are unable to
proceed, because each holds a
**lock** that the other needs.
Because both transactions are waiting for a resource to become
available, neither one ever releases the locks it holds.


A deadlock can occur when the transactions lock rows in multiple
tables (through statements such as `UPDATE` or
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), but in the opposite
order. A deadlock can also occur when such statements lock
ranges of index records and
**gaps**, with each transaction
acquiring some locks but not others due to a timing issue.


For background information on how deadlocks are automatically
detected and handled, see
[Section 17.7.5.2, “Deadlock Detection”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-deadlock-detection.html "17.7.5.2 Deadlock Detection"). For tips on
avoiding and recovering from deadlock conditions, see
[Section 17.7.5.3, “How to Minimize and Handle Deadlocks”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-deadlocks-handling.html "17.7.5.3 How to Minimize and Handle Deadlocks").


See Also [gap](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_gap), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

deadlock detection

A mechanism that automatically detects when a
**deadlock** occurs, and
automatically **rolls back** one of
the **transactions** involved (the
**victim**). Deadlock detection can
be disabled using the
[`innodb_deadlock_detect`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_deadlock_detect)
configuration option.


See Also [deadlock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_deadlock), [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction), [victim](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_victim).

delete

When `InnoDB` processes a
`DELETE` statement, the rows are immediately
marked for deletion and no longer are returned by queries. The
storage is reclaimed sometime later, during the periodic garbage
collection known as the **purge**
operation. For removing large quantities of data, related
operations with their own performance characteristics are
**TRUNCATE** and
**DROP**.


See Also [drop](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_drop), [purge](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_purge), [truncate](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_truncate).

delete buffering

The technique of storing changes to secondary index pages,
resulting from `DELETE` operations, in the
**change buffer** rather than
writing the changes immediately, so that the physical writes can
be performed to minimize random I/O. (Because delete operations
are a two-step process, this operation buffers the write that
normally marks an index record for deletion.) It is one of the
types of **change buffering**; the
others are **insert buffering** and
**purge buffering**.

denormalized

A data storage strategy that duplicates data across different
tables, rather than linking the tables with
**foreign keys** and
**join** queries. Typically used in
**data warehouse** applications,
where the data is not updated after loading. In such
applications, query performance is more important than making it
simple to maintain consistent data during updates. Contrast with
**normalized**.


See Also [data warehouse](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_warehouse), [foreign key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_foreign_key), [join](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_join), [normalized](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_normalized).

descending index

A type of **index** where index
storage is optimized to process `ORDER BY
        column DESC` clauses.


See Also [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index).

dictionary object cache

The dictionary object cache stores previously accessed
**data dictionary** objects in
memory to enable object reuse and minimize disk I/O. An
**LRU**-based eviction strategy is
used to evict least recently used objects from memory. The cache
is comprised of several partitions that store different object
types.


For more information, see
[Section 16.4, “Dictionary Object Cache”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-dictionary-object-cache.html "16.4 Dictionary Object Cache").


See Also [data dictionary](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_dictionary), [LRU](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lru).

dirty page

A **page** in the
`InnoDB` **buffer**
**pool** that has been updated in memory, where the
changes are not yet written
(**flushed**) to the
**data files**. The opposite of a
**clean page**.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [clean page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_clean_page), [data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page).

dirty read

An operation that retrieves unreliable data, data that was
updated by another transaction but not yet
**committed**. It is only possible
with the **isolation level** known
as **read uncommitted**.


This kind of operation does not adhere to the
**ACID** principle of database
design. It is considered very risky, because the data could be
**rolled back**, or updated further
before being committed; then, the transaction doing the dirty
read would be using data that was never confirmed as accurate.


Its opposite is **consistent**
**read**, where `InnoDB` ensures that a
transaction does not read information updated by another
transaction, even if the other transaction commits in the
meantime.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [consistent read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [READ UNCOMMITTED](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_uncommitted), [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback).

disk-based

A kind of database that primarily organizes data on disk storage
(hard drives or equivalent). Data is brought back and forth
between disk and memory to be operated upon. It is the opposite
of an **in-memory database**.
Although `InnoDB` is disk-based, it also
contains features such as he **buffer**
**pool**, multiple buffer pool instances, and the
**adaptive hash index** that allow
certain kinds of workloads to work primarily from memory.


See Also [adaptive hash index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_adaptive_hash_index), [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [in-memory database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_in_memory_database).

disk-bound

A type of **workload** where the
primary **bottleneck** is disk I/O.
(Also known as **I/O-bound**.)
Typically involves frequent writes to disk, or random reads of
more data than can fit into the **buffer**
**pool**.


See Also [bottleneck](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_bottleneck), [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [workload](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_workload).

DML

Data manipulation language, a set of
**SQL** statements for performing
[`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
[`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operations. The
[`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement is sometimes
considered as a DML statement, because the `SELECT ...
        FOR UPDATE` form is subject to the same considerations
for **locking** as
[`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
[`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html "15.2.2 DELETE Statement").


DML statements for an `InnoDB` table operate in
the context of a **transaction**,
so their effects can be
**committed** or
**rolled back** as a single unit.


Contrast with **DDL** and
**DCL**.


See Also [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [DCL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dcl), [DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ddl), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback), [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sql), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

document id

In the `InnoDB` **full-text**
**search** feature, a special column in the table
containing the **FULLTEXT index**,
to uniquely identify the document associated with each
**ilist** value. Its name is
`FTS_DOC_ID` (uppercase required). The column
itself must be of `BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL`
type, with a unique index named
`FTS_DOC_ID_INDEX`. Preferably, you define this
column when creating the table. If `InnoDB`
must add the column to the table while creating a
`FULLTEXT` index, the indexing operation is
considerably more expensive.


See Also [full-text search](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_full_text_search), [FULLTEXT index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fulltext_index), [ilist](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ilist).

doublewrite buffer

`InnoDB` uses a file flush technique called
doublewrite. Before writing
**pages** to the
**data files**,
`InnoDB` first writes them to a storage area
called the doublewrite buffer. Only after the write and the
flush to the doublewrite buffer have completed, does
`InnoDB` write the pages to their proper
positions in the data file. If there is an operating system,
storage subsystem or [**mysqld**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld.html "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process crash in
the middle of a page write, `InnoDB` can find a
good copy of the page from the doublewrite buffer during
**crash recovery**.


Although data is always written twice, the doublewrite buffer
does not require twice as much I/O overhead or twice as many I/O
operations. Data is written to the buffer itself as a large
sequential chunk, with a single `fsync()` call
to the operating system.


See Also [crash recovery](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_crash_recovery), [data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page), [purge](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_purge).

drop

A kind of **DDL** operation that
removes a schema object, through a statement such as
[`DROP TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-table.html "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") or
[`DROP INDEX`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-index.html "15.1.27 DROP INDEX Statement"). It maps internally to
an [`ALTER TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement. From an
`InnoDB` perspective, the performance
considerations of such operations involve the time that the
**data dictionary** is locked to
ensure that interrelated objects are all updated, and the time
to update memory structures such as the
**buffer pool**. For a
**table**, the drop operation has
somewhat different characteristics than a
**truncate** operation
( [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/truncate-table.html "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") statement).


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [data dictionary](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_dictionary), [DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ddl), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table), [truncate](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_truncate).

DSN

Acronym for “Database Source Name”. It is the
encoding for **connection**
information within
**Connector/ODBC**. See
[Configuring a Connector/ODBC DSN on Windows](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/connector-odbc-configuration-dsn-windows.html) for
full details. It is the equivalent of the
**connection string** used by
**Connector/NET**.


See Also [connection](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connection), [connection string](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connection_string), [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_net), [Connector/ODBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_odbc).

dynamic cursor

A type of **cursor** supported by
**ODBC** that can pick up new and
changed results when the rows are read again. Whether and how
quickly the changes are visible to the cursor depends on the
type of table involved (transactional or non-transactional) and
the isolation level for transactional tables. Support for
dynamic cursors must be explicitly enabled.


See Also [cursor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cursor), [ODBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_odbc).

dynamic row format

An `InnoDB` row format. Because long
variable-length column values are stored outside of the page
that holds the row data, it is very efficient for rows that
include large objects. Since the large fields are typically not
accessed to evaluate query conditions, they are not brought into
the **buffer pool** as often,
resulting in fewer I/O operations and better utilization of
cache memory.


As of MySQL 5.7.9, the default row format is defined by
[`innodb_default_row_format`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format),
which has a default value of `DYNAMIC`.


For additional information about `InnoDB` `DYNAMIC` row format, see
[DYNAMIC Row Format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-row-format.html#innodb-row-format-dynamic "DYNAMIC Row Format").


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [file format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_format), [row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_format).

dynamic SQL

A feature that lets you create and execute
**prepared statements** using more
robust, secure, and efficient methods to substitute parameter
values than the naive technique of concatenating the parts of
the statement into a string variable.


See Also [prepared statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_prepared_statement).

dynamic statement

A **prepared statement** created
and executed through **dynamic**
**SQL**.

See Also [dynamic SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dynamic_sql), [prepared statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_prepared_statement).

### E

early adopter

A stage similar to **beta**, when a
software product is typically evaluated for performance,
functionality, and compatibility in a non-mission-critical
setting.


See Also [beta](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_beta).

Eiffel

A programming language including many object-oriented features.
Some of its concepts are familiar to
**Java** and
**C#** developers. For the
open-source Eiffel **API** for
MySQL, see [Section 31.13, “MySQL Eiffel Wrapper”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/apis-eiffel.html "31.13 MySQL Eiffel Wrapper").


See Also [API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_api), [C#](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_csharp), [Java](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_java).

embedded

The embedded MySQL server library
(**libmysqld**) makes it possible
to run a full-featured MySQL server inside a
**client** application. The main
benefits are increased speed and more simple management for
embedded applications.


See Also [client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_client), [libmysqld](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_libmysqld).

error log

A type of **log** showing
information about MySQL startup and critical runtime errors and
**crash** information. For details,
see [Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/error-log.html "7.4.2 The Error Log").


See Also [crash](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_crash), [log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_log).

eviction

The process of removing an item from a cache or other temporary
storage area, such as the `InnoDB` **buffer pool**. Often, but not
always, uses the **LRU** algorithm
to determine which item to remove. When a
**dirty page** is evicted, its
contents are **flushed** to disk,
and any dirty **neighbor pages**
might be flushed also.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [dirty page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dirty_page), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [LRU](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lru), [neighbor page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_neighbor_page).

exception interceptor

A type of **interceptor** for
tracing, debugging, or augmenting SQL errors encountered by a
database application. For example, the interceptor code could
issue a `SHOW WARNINGS` statement to retrieve
additional information, and add descriptive text or even change
the type of the exception returned to the application. Because
the interceptor code is only called when SQL statements return
errors, it does not impose any performance penalty on the
application during normal (error-free) operation.


In **Java** applications using
**Connector/J**, setting up this
type of interceptor involves implementing the
`com.mysql.jdbc.ExceptionInterceptor`
interface, and adding a `exceptionInterceptors`
property to the **connection**
**string**.


In **Visual Studio** applications
using **Connector/NET**, setting up this
type of interceptor involves defining a class that inherits from
the `BaseExceptionInterceptor` class and
specifying that class name as part of the connection string.


See Also [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_net), [interceptor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_interceptor), [Java](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_java), [Visual Studio](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_visual_studio).

exclusive lock

A kind of **lock** that prevents
any other **transaction** from
locking the same row. Depending on the transaction
**isolation level**, this kind of
lock might block other transactions from writing to the same
row, or might also block other transactions from reading the
same row. The default `InnoDB` isolation level,
**REPEATABLE READ**, enables higher
**concurrency** by allowing
transactions to read rows that have exclusive locks, a technique
known as **consistent read**.


See Also [concurrency](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_concurrency), [consistent read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [REPEATABLE READ](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_repeatable_read), [shared lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_shared_lock), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

extent

A group of **pages** within a
**tablespace**. For the default
**page size** of 16KB, an extent
contains 64 pages. In MySQL 5.6, the page size for an
`InnoDB` instance can be 4KB, 8KB, or 16KB,
controlled by the
[`innodb_page_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_page_size) configuration
option. For 4KB, 8KB, and 16KB pages sizes, the extent size is
always 1MB (or 1048576 bytes).


Support for 32KB and 64KB `InnoDB` page sizes
was added in MySQL 5.7.6. For a 32KB page size, the extent size
is 2MB. For a 64KB page size, the extent size is 4MB.


`InnoDB` features such as
**segments**,
**read-ahead** requests and the
**doublewrite buffer** use I/O
operations that read, write, allocate, or free data one extent
at a time.

See Also [doublewrite buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_doublewrite_buffer), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page), [page size](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page_size), [read-ahead](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_ahead), [segment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_segment), [tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_tablespace).

### F

.frm file

A file containing the metadata, such as the table definition, of
a MySQL table. `.frm` files were removed in
MySQL 8.0 but are still used in earlier MySQL releases. In MySQL
8.0, data previously stored in `.frm` files
is stored in **data dictionary**
tables.


See Also [data dictionary](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_dictionary), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace).

failover

The ability to automatically switch to a standby server in the
event of a failure. In the MySQL context, failover involves a
standby database server. Often supported within
**J2EE** environments by the
application server or framework.


See Also [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [J2EE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_j2ee).

Fast Index Creation

A capability first introduced in the InnoDB Plugin, now part of
MySQL in 5.5 and higher, that speeds up creation of
`InnoDB` **secondary**
**indexes** by avoiding the need to completely rewrite
the associated table. The speedup applies to dropping secondary
indexes also.


Because index maintenance can add performance overhead to many
data transfer operations, consider doing operations such as
`ALTER TABLE ... ENGINE=INNODB` or
`INSERT INTO ... SELECT * FROM ...` without any
secondary indexes in place, and creating the indexes afterward.


In MySQL 5.6, this feature becomes more general. You can read
and write to tables while an index is being created, and many
more kinds of [`ALTER TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
operations can be performed without copying the table, without
blocking **DML** operations, or
both. Thus in MySQL 5.6 and higher, this set of features is
referred to as **online DDL**
rather than Fast Index Creation.


For related information, see
[Section 17.12, “InnoDB and Online DDL”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-online-ddl.html "17.12 InnoDB and Online DDL").


See Also [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [online DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_online_ddl), [secondary index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_secondary_index).

fast shutdown

The default **shutdown** procedure
for `InnoDB`, based on the configuration
setting [`innodb_fast_shutdown=1`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_fast_shutdown).
To save time, certain **flush**
operations are skipped. This type of shutdown is safe during
normal usage, because the flush operations are performed during
the next startup, using the same mechanism as in
**crash recovery**. In cases where
the database is being shut down for an upgrade or downgrade, do
a **slow shutdown** instead to
ensure that all relevant changes are applied to the
**data files** during the shutdown.


See Also [crash recovery](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_crash_recovery), [data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_shutdown), [slow shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_slow_shutdown).

file format

The file format for `InnoDB` tables.


See Also [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [.ibd file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ibd_file), [ibdata file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ibdata_file), [row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_format).

file-per-table

A general name for the setting controlled by the
[`innodb_file_per_table`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) option,
which is an important configuration option that affects aspects
of `InnoDB` file storage, availability of
features, and I/O characteristics. As of MySQL 5.6.7,
[`innodb_file_per_table`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) is
enabled by default.


With the [`innodb_file_per_table`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table)
option enabled, you can create a table in its own
**.ibd file** rather than in the
shared **ibdata files** of the
**system tablespace**. When table
data is stored in an individual **.ibd**
**file**, you have more flexibility to choose
**row formats** required for
features such as data
**compression**. The
`TRUNCATE TABLE` operation is also faster, and
reclaimed space can be used by the operating system rather than
remaining reserved for `InnoDB`.


The **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product is more
flexible for tables that are in their own files. For example,
tables can be excluded from a backup, but only if they are in
separate files. Thus, this setting is suitable for tables that
are backed up less frequently or on a different schedule.

fill factor

In an `InnoDB` **index**, the proportion of a
**page** that is taken up by index
data before the page is split. The unused space when index data
is first divided between pages allows for rows to be updated
with longer string values without requiring expensive index
maintenance operations. If the fill factor is too low, the index
consumes more space than needed, causing extra I/O overhead when
reading the index. If the fill factor is too high, any update
that increases the length of column values can cause extra I/O
overhead for index maintenance. See
[Section 17.6.2.2, “The Physical Structure of an InnoDB Index”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-physical-structure.html "17.6.2.2 The Physical Structure of an InnoDB Index") for more
information.


See Also [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page).

fixed row format

This row format is used by the `MyISAM` storage
engine, not by `InnoDB`. If you create an
`InnoDB` table with the option
`ROW_FORMAT=FIXED` in MySQL 5.7.6 or earlier,
`InnoDB` uses the **compact**
**row format** instead, although the
`FIXED` value might still show up in output
such as `SHOW TABLE STATUS` reports. As of
MySQL 5.7.7, `InnoDB` returns an error if
`ROW_FORMAT=FIXED` is specified.


See Also [compact row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compact_row_format), [row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_format).

flush

To write changes to the database files, that had been buffered
in a memory area or a temporary disk storage area. The
`InnoDB` storage structures that are
periodically flushed include the **redo**
**log**, the **undo log**,
and the **buffer pool**.


Flushing can happen because a memory area becomes full and the
system needs to free some space, because a
**commit** operation means the
changes from a transaction can be finalized, or because a
**slow shutdown** operation means
that all outstanding work should be finalized. When it is not
critical to flush all the buffered data at once,
`InnoDB` can use a technique called
**fuzzy checkpointing** to flush
small batches of pages to spread out the I/O overhead.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [fuzzy checkpointing](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fuzzy_checkpointing), [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log), [slow shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_slow_shutdown), [undo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log).

flush list

An internal `InnoDB` data structure that tracks
**dirty pages** in the
**buffer pool**: that is,
**pages** that have been changed
and need to be written back out to disk. This data structure is
updated frequently by `InnoDB` internal
**mini-transactions**, and so is
protected by its own **mutex** to
allow concurrent access to the buffer pool.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [dirty page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dirty_page), [LRU](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lru), [mini-transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mini_transaction), [mutex](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mutex), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page), [page cleaner](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page_cleaner).

foreign key

A type of pointer relationship, between rows in separate
`InnoDB` tables. The foreign key relationship
is defined on one column in both the
**parent table** and the
**child table**.


In addition to enabling fast lookup of related information,
foreign keys help to enforce **referential**
**integrity**, by preventing any of these pointers from
becoming invalid as data is inserted, updated, and deleted. This
enforcement mechanism is a type of
**constraint**. A row that points
to another table cannot be inserted if the associated foreign
key value does not exist in the other table. If a row is deleted
or its foreign key value changed, and rows in another table
point to that foreign key value, the foreign key can be set up
to prevent the deletion, cause the corresponding column values
in the other table to become
**null**, or automatically delete
the corresponding rows in the other table.


One of the stages in designing a
**normalized** database is to
identify data that is duplicated, separate that data into a new
table, and set up a foreign key relationship so that the
multiple tables can be queried like a single table, using a
**join** operation.


See Also [child table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_child_table), [FOREIGN KEY constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_foreign_key_constraint), [join](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_join), [normalized](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_normalized), [NULL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_null), [parent table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_parent_table), [referential integrity](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_referential_integrity), [relational](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_relational).

FOREIGN KEY constraint

The type of **constraint** that
maintains database consistency through a
**foreign key** relationship. Like
other kinds of constraints, it can prevent data from being
inserted or updated if data would become inconsistent; in this
case, the inconsistency being prevented is between data in
multiple tables. Alternatively, when a
**DML** operation is performed,
`FOREIGN KEY` constraints can cause data in
**child rows** to be deleted,
changed to different values, or set to
**null**, based on the `ON
        CASCADE` option specified when creating the foreign
key.


See Also [child table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_child_table), [constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_constraint), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [foreign key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_foreign_key), [NULL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_null).

FTS

In most contexts, an acronym for **full-text**
**search**. Sometimes in performance discussions, an
acronym for **full table scan**.


See Also [full table scan](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_full_table_scan), [full-text search](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_full_text_search).

full backup

A **backup** that includes all the
**tables** in each MySQL
**database**, and all the databases
in a MySQL **instance**. Contrast
with **partial backup**.


See Also [backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_backup), [database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_database), [instance](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_instance), [partial backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_partial_backup), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table).

full table scan

An operation that requires reading the entire contents of a
table, rather than just selected portions using an
**index**. Typically performed
either with small lookup tables, or in data warehousing
situations with large tables where all available data is
aggregated and analyzed. How frequently these operations occur,
and the sizes of the tables relative to available memory, have
implications for the algorithms used in query optimization and
managing the **buffer pool**.


The purpose of indexes is to allow lookups for specific values
or ranges of values within a large table, thus avoiding full
table scans when practical.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index).

full-text search

The MySQL feature for finding words, phrases, Boolean
combinations of words, and so on within table data, in a faster,
more convenient, and more flexible way than using the SQL
`LIKE` operator or writing your own
application-level search algorithm. It uses the SQL function
[`MATCH()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-search.html#function_match) and
**FULLTEXT indexes**.


See Also [FULLTEXT index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fulltext_index).

FULLTEXT index

The special kind of **index** that
holds the **search index** in the
MySQL **full-text search**
mechanism. Represents the words from values of a column,
omitting any that are specified as
**stopwords**. Originally, only
available for `MyISAM` tables. Starting in
MySQL 5.6.4, it is also available for
**InnoDB** tables.


See Also [full-text search](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_full_text_search), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb), [search index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_search_index), [stopword](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_stopword).

fuzzy checkpointing

A technique that **flushes** small
batches of **dirty pages** from the
**buffer pool**, rather than
flushing all dirty pages at once which would disrupt database
processing.

See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [dirty page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dirty_page), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush).

### G

GA

“Generally available”, the stage when a software
product leaves **beta** and is
available for sale, official support, and production use.


See Also [beta](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_beta).

GAC

Acronym for “Global Assembly Cache”. A central area
for storing libraries
(**assemblies**) on a
**.NET** system. Physically
consists of nested folders, treated as a single virtual folder
by the **.NET** CLR.


See Also [.NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos__net), [assembly](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_assembly).

gap

A place in an `InnoDB` **index** data structure where new
values could be inserted. When you lock a set of rows with a
statement such as `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`,
`InnoDB` can create locks that apply to the
gaps as well as the actual values in the index. For example, if
you select all values greater than 10 for update, a gap lock
prevents another transaction from inserting a new value that is
greater than 10. The **supremum**
**record** and **infimum**
**record** represent the gaps containing all values
greater than or less than all the current index values.


See Also [concurrency](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_concurrency), [gap lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_gap_lock), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [infimum record](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_infimum_record), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [supremum record](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_supremum_record).

gap lock

A **lock** on a
**gap** between index records, or a
lock on the gap before the first or after the last index record.
For example, `SELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c1 BETWEEN 10 and
        20 FOR UPDATE;` prevents other transactions from
inserting a value of 15 into the column `t.c1`,
whether or not there was already any such value in the column,
because the gaps between all existing values in the range are
locked. Contrast with **record**
**lock** and **next-key**
**lock**.


Gap locks are part of the tradeoff between performance and
**concurrency**, and are used in
some transaction **isolation**
**levels** and not others.


See Also [gap](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_gap), [infimum record](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_infimum_record), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [next-key lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_next_key_lock), [record lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_record_lock), [supremum record](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_supremum_record).

general log

See [general query log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_general_query_log).

general query log

A type of **log** used for
diagnosis and troubleshooting of SQL statements processed by the
MySQL server. Can be stored in a file or in a database table.
You must enable this feature through the
[`general_log`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_general_log) configuration
option to use it. You can disable it for a specific connection
through the [`sql_log_off`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_sql_log_off)
configuration option.


Records a broader range of queries than the
**slow query log**. Unlike the
**binary log**, which is used for
replication, the general query log contains
[`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements and does not
maintain strict ordering. For more information, see
[Section 7.4.3, “The General Query Log”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/query-log.html "7.4.3 The General Query Log").


See Also [binary log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_binary_log), [log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_log), [slow query log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_slow_query_log).

general tablespace

A shared `InnoDB` **tablespace** created using
[`CREATE TABLESPACE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-tablespace.html "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax. General
tablespaces can be created outside of the MySQL data directory,
are capable of holding multiple
**tables**, and support tables of
all row formats. General tablespaces were introduced in MySQL
5.7.6.


Tables are added to a general tablespace using
[`CREATE TABLE\\
        tbl_name ... TABLESPACE [=]\\
        tablespace_name`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table.html "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER TABLE\\
        tbl_name TABLESPACE [=]\\
        tablespace_name`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") syntax.


Contrast with **system tablespace**
and **file-per-table** tablespace.


For more information, see [Section 17.6.3.3, “General Tablespaces”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/general-tablespaces.html "17.6.3.3 General Tablespaces").


See Also [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table), [tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_tablespace).

generated column

A column whose values are computed from an expression included
in the column definition. A generated column can be
**virtual** or
**stored**.


See Also [base column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_base_column), [stored generated column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_stored_generated_column), [virtual generated column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_virtual_generated_column).

Glassfish

See Also [J2EE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_j2ee).

global temporary tablespace

A _temporary tablespace_ that stores
_rollback segments_ for changes made to
user-created temporary tables.


See Also [temporary tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_temporary_tablespace).

global transaction

A type of **transaction** involved
in **XA** operations. It consists
of several actions that are transactional in themselves, but
that all must either complete successfully as a group, or all be
rolled back as a group. In essence, this extends
**ACID** properties “up a
level” so that multiple ACID transactions can be executed
in concert as components of a global operation that also has
ACID properties.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction), [XA](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_xa).

group commit

An `InnoDB` optimization that performs some
low-level I/O operations (log write) once for a set of
**commit** operations, rather than
flushing and syncing separately for each commit.


See Also [binary log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_binary_log), [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit).

GUID

Acronym for “globally unique identifier”, an ID
value that can be used to associate data across different
databases, languages, operating systems, and so on. (As an
alternative to using sequential integers, where the same values
could appear in different tables, databases, and so on referring
to different data.) Older MySQL versions represented it as
`BINARY(16)`. Currently, it is represented as
`CHAR(36)`. MySQL has a
`UUID()` function that returns GUID values in
character format, and a `UUID_SHORT()` function
that returns GUID values in integer format. Because successive
GUID values are not necessarily in ascending sort order, it is
not an efficient value to use as a primary key for large InnoDB
tables.

### H

hash index

A type of **index** intended for
queries that use equality operators, rather than range operators
such as greater-than or `BETWEEN`. It is
available for [`MEMORY`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/memory-storage-engine.html "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables.
Although hash indexes are the default for
[`MEMORY`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/memory-storage-engine.html "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables for historic reasons,
that storage engine also supports
**B-tree** indexes, which are often
a better choice for general-purpose queries.


MySQL includes a variant of this index type, the
**adaptive hash index**, that is
constructed automatically for
[`InnoDB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables if needed based on
runtime conditions.


See Also [adaptive hash index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_adaptive_hash_index), [B-tree](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_b_tree), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb).

HDD

Acronym for “hard disk drive”. Refers to storage
media using spinning platters, usually when comparing and
contrasting with **SSD**. Its
performance characteristics can influence the throughput of a
**disk-based** workload.


See Also [disk-based](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_disk_based), [SSD](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ssd).

heartbeat

A periodic message that is sent to indicate that a system is
functioning properly. In a
**replication** context, if the
**source** stops sending such
messages, one of the **replicas**
can take its place. Similar techniques can be used between the
servers in a cluster environment, to confirm that all of them
are operating properly.


See Also [replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replication), [source](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_source).

high-water mark

A value representing an upper limit, either a hard limit that
should not be exceeded at runtime, or a record of the maximum
value that was actually reached. Contrast with
**low-water mark**.


See Also [low-water mark](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_low_water_mark).

history list

A list of **transactions** with
delete-marked records scheduled to be processed by the
`InnoDB` **purge**
operation. Recorded in the **undo**
**log**. The length of the history list is reported by
the command `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`. If the
history list grows longer than the value of the
[`innodb_max_purge_lag`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag)
configuration option, each **DML**
operation is delayed slightly to allow the purge operation to
finish **flushing** the deleted
records.


Also known as **purge lag**.


See Also [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [purge](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_purge), [purge lag](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_purge_lag), [rollback segment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback_segment), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction), [undo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log).

hole punching

Releasing empty blocks from a page. The
`InnoDB` **transparent page**
**compression** feature relies on hole punching support.
For more information, see
[Section 17.9.2, “InnoDB Page Compression”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-page-compression.html "17.9.2 InnoDB Page Compression").

host

The network name of a database server, used to establish a
**connection**. Often specified in
conjunction with a **port**. In
some contexts, the IP address `127.0.0.1` works
better than the special name `localhost` for
accessing a database on the same server as the application.


See Also [connection](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connection), [localhost](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_localhost), [port](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_port).

hot

A condition where a row, table, or internal data structure is
accessed so frequently, requiring some form of locking or mutual
exclusion, that it results in a performance or scalability
issue.


Although “hot” typically indicates an undesirable
condition, a **hot backup** is the
preferred type of backup.


See Also [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup).

hot backup

A backup taken while the database is running and applications
are reading and writing to it. The backup involves more than
simply copying data files: it must include any data that was
inserted or updated while the backup was in process; it must
exclude any data that was deleted while the backup was in
process; and it must ignore any changes that were not committed.


The Oracle product that performs hot backups, of
`InnoDB` tables especially but also tables from
`MyISAM` and other storage engines, is known as
**MySQL Enterprise Backup**.


The hot backup process consists of two stages. The initial
copying of the data files produces a **raw**
**backup**. The **apply**
step incorporates any changes to the database that happened
while the backup was running. Applying the changes produces a
**prepared** backup; these files
are ready to be restored whenever necessary.

See Also [apply](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_apply), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [prepared backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_prepared_backup), [raw backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_raw_backup).

### I

.ibd file

The data file for
**file-per-table** tablespaces and
general tablespaces. File-per-table tablespace
`.ibd` files contain a single table and
associated index data. **General**
**tablespace** `.ibd` files may contain
table and index data for multiple tables.


The `.ibd` file extension does not apply to the
**system tablespace**, which
consists of one or more **ibdata**
**files**.


If a file-per-table tablespace or general tablespace is created
with the `DATA DIRECTORY =` clause, the
`.ibd` file is located at the specified path,
outside the normal data directory.


When a `.ibd` file is included in a compressed
backup by the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product,
the compressed equivalent is a `.ibz` file.


See Also [database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_database), [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [general tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_general_tablespace), [ibdata file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ibdata_file), [.ibz file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ibz_file), [innodb\_file\_per\_table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb_file_per_table), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace).

.ibz file

When the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product performs
a **compressed backup**, it
transforms each **tablespace** file
that is created using the
**file-per-table** setting from a
`.ibd` extension to a `.ibz`
extension.


The compression applied during backup is distinct from the
**compressed row format** that
keeps table data compressed during normal operation. A
compressed backup operation skips the compression step for a
tablespace that is already in compressed row format, as
compressing a second time would slow down the backup but produce
little or no space savings.


See Also [compressed backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compressed_backup), [compressed row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compressed_row_format), [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [.ibd file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ibd_file), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_tablespace).

I/O-bound

See [disk-bound](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_disk_bound).

ib-file set

The set of files managed by `InnoDB` within a
MySQL database: the **system**
**tablespace**,
**file-per-table** tablespace
files, and **redo log** files.
Depending on MySQL version and `InnoDB`
configuration, may also include **general**
**tablespace**, **temporary**
**tablespace**, and **undo**
**tablespace** files. This term is sometimes used in
detailed discussions of `InnoDB` file
structures and formats to refer to the set of files managed by
`InnoDB` within a MySQL database.


See Also [database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_database), [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [general tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_general_tablespace), [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace), [temporary tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_temporary_tablespace), [undo tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_tablespace).

ibbackup\_logfile

A supplemental backup file created by the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product during a
**hot backup** operation. It
contains information about any data changes that occurred while
the backup was running. The initial backup files, including
`ibbackup_logfile`, are known as a
**raw backup**, because the changes
that occurred during the backup operation are not yet
incorporated. After you perform the
**apply** step to the raw backup
files, the resulting files do include those final data changes,
and are known as a **prepared**
**backup**. At this stage, the
`ibbackup_logfile` file is no longer necessary.


See Also [apply](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_apply), [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [prepared backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_prepared_backup), [raw backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_raw_backup).

ibdata file

A set of files with names such as `ibdata1`,
`ibdata2`, and so on, that make up the
`InnoDB` **system**
**tablespace**. For information about the structures and
data that reside in the system tablespace
`ibdata` files, see
[Section 17.6.3.1, “The System Tablespace”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-system-tablespace.html "17.6.3.1 The System Tablespace").


Growth of the `ibdata` files is influenced by
the [`innodb_autoextend_increment`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoextend_increment)
configuration option.


See Also [change buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffer), [data dictionary](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_dictionary), [doublewrite buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_doublewrite_buffer), [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [.ibd file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ibd_file), [innodb\_file\_per\_table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb_file_per_table), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace), [undo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log).

ibtmp file

The `InnoDB` **temporary**
**tablespace****data file**
for non-compressed `InnoDB` **temporary tables** and related
objects. The configuration file option,
[`innodb_temp_data_file_path`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_temp_data_file_path),
allows users to define a relative path for the temporary
tablespace data file. If
[`innodb_temp_data_file_path`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_temp_data_file_path) is
not specified, the default behavior is to create a single
auto-extending 12MB data file named `ibtmp1`
in the data directory, alongside `ibdata1`.


See Also [data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files), [temporary table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_temporary_table), [temporary tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_temporary_tablespace).

ib\_logfile

A set of files, typically named `ib_logfile0`
and `ib_logfile1`, that form the
**redo log**. Also sometimes
referred to as the **log group**.
These files record statements that attempt to change data in
`InnoDB` tables. These statements are replayed
automatically to correct data written by incomplete
transactions, on startup following a crash.


This data cannot be used for manual recovery; for that type of
operation, use the **binary log**.


See Also [binary log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_binary_log), [log group](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_log_group), [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log).

ilist

Within an `InnoDB` **FULLTEXT index**, the data
structure consisting of a document ID and positional information
for a token (that is, a particular word).


See Also [FULLTEXT index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fulltext_index).

implicit row lock

A row lock that `InnoDB` acquires to ensure
consistency, without you specifically requesting it.


See Also [row lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_lock).

in-memory database

A type of database system that maintains data in memory, to
avoid overhead due to disk I/O and translation between disk
blocks and memory areas. Some in-memory databases sacrifice
durability (the “D” in the
**ACID** design philosophy) and are
vulnerable to hardware, power, and other types of failures,
making them more suitable for read-only operations. Other
in-memory databases do use durability mechanisms such as logging
changes to disk or using non-volatile memory.


MySQL features that address the same kinds of memory-intensive
processing include the `InnoDB` **buffer pool**,
**adaptive hash index**, and
**read-only transaction**
optimization, the [`MEMORY`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/memory-storage-engine.html "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") storage
engine, the `MyISAM` key cache, and the MySQL
query cache.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [adaptive hash index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_adaptive_hash_index), [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [disk-based](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_disk_based), [read-only transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_only_transaction).

incremental backup

A type of **hot backup**, performed
by the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, that only
saves data changed since some point in time. Having a full
backup and a succession of incremental backups lets you
reconstruct backup data over a long period, without the storage
overhead of keeping several full backups on hand. You can
restore the full backup and then apply each of the incremental
backups in succession, or you can keep the full backup
up-to-date by applying each incremental backup to it, then
perform a single restore operation.


The granularity of changed data is at the
**page** level. A page might
actually cover more than one row. Each changed page is included
in the backup.


See Also [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page).

index

A data structure that provides a fast lookup capability for
**rows** of a
**table**, typically by forming a
tree structure (**B-tree)**
representing all the values of a particular
**column** or set of columns.


`InnoDB` tables always have a
**clustered index** representing
the **primary key**. They can also
have one or more **secondary**
**indexes** defined on one or more columns. Depending on
their structure, secondary indexes can be classified as
**partial**,
**column**, or
**composite** indexes.


Indexes are a crucial aspect of
**query** performance. Database
architects design tables, queries, and indexes to allow fast
lookups for data needed by applications. The ideal database
design uses a **covering index**
where practical; the query results are computed entirely from
the index, without reading the actual table data. Each
**foreign key** constraint also
requires an index, to efficiently check whether values exist in
both the **parent** and
**child** tables.


Although a B-tree index is the most common, a different kind of
data structure is used for **hash**
**indexes**, as in the `MEMORY` storage
engine and the `InnoDB` **adaptive hash index**.
**R-tree** indexes are used for
spatial indexing of multi-dimensional information.


See Also [adaptive hash index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_adaptive_hash_index), [B-tree](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_b_tree), [child table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_child_table), [clustered index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_clustered_index), [column index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_column_index), [composite index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_composite_index), [covering index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_covering_index), [foreign key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_foreign_key), [hash index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hash_index), [parent table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_parent_table), [partial index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_partial_index), [primary key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_primary_key), [query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query), [R-tree](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_r_tree), [row](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row), [secondary index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_secondary_index), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table).

index cache

A memory area that holds the token data for
`InnoDB` **full-text**
**search**. It buffers the data to minimize disk I/O when
data is inserted or updated in columns that are part of a
**FULLTEXT index**. The token data
is written to disk when the index cache becomes full. Each
`InnoDB` `FULLTEXT` index has
its own separate index cache, whose size is controlled by the
configuration option
[`innodb_ft_cache_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_ft_cache_size).


See Also [full-text search](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_full_text_search), [FULLTEXT index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fulltext_index).

index condition pushdown

Index condition pushdown (ICP) is an optimization that pushes
part of a `WHERE` condition down to the storage
engine if parts of the condition can be evaluated using fields
from the **index**. ICP can reduce
the number of times the **storage**
**engine** must access the base table and the number of
times the MySQL server must access the storage engine. For more
information, see
[Section 10.2.1.6, “Index Condition Pushdown Optimization”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/index-condition-pushdown-optimization.html "10.2.1.6 Index Condition Pushdown Optimization").


See Also [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [storage engine](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_storage_engine).

index hint

Extended SQL syntax for overriding the
**indexes** recommended by the
optimizer. For example, the `FORCE INDEX`,
`USE INDEX`, and `IGNORE
        INDEX` clauses. Typically used when indexed columns
have unevenly distributed values, resulting in inaccurate
**cardinality** estimates.


See Also [cardinality](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cardinality), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index).

index prefix

In an **index** that applies to
multiple columns (known as a **composite**
**index**), the initial or leading columns of the index.
A query that references the first 1, 2, 3, and so on columns of
a composite index can use the index, even if the query does not
reference all the columns in the index.


See Also [composite index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_composite_index), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index).

index statistics

See [statistics](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_statistics).

infimum record

A **pseudo-record** in an
**index**, representing the
**gap** below the smallest value in
that index. If a transaction has a statement such as
`SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE col < 10 FOR
        UPDATE;`, and the smallest value in the column is 5, it
is a lock on the infimum record that prevents other transactions
from inserting even smaller values such as 0, -10, and so on.


See Also [gap](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_gap), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [pseudo-record](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_pseudo_record), [supremum record](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_supremum_record).

INFORMATION\_SCHEMA

The name of the **database** that
provides a query interface to the MySQL
**data dictionary**. (This name is
defined by the ANSI SQL standard.) To examine information
(metadata) about the database, you can query tables such as
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` and
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`, rather than using
`SHOW` commands that produce unstructured
output.


The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database also contains
tables specific to **InnoDB** that
provide a query interface to the `InnoDB` data
dictionary. You use these tables not to see how the database is
structured, but to get real-time information about the workings
of `InnoDB` tables to help with performance
monitoring, tuning, and troubleshooting.


See Also [data dictionary](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_dictionary), [database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_database), [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb).

InnoDB

A MySQL component that combines high performance with
**transactional** capability for
reliability, robustness, and concurrent access. It embodies the
**ACID** design philosophy.
Represented as a **storage**
**engine**; it handles tables created or altered with the
`ENGINE=INNODB` clause. See
[Chapter 17, _The InnoDB Storage Engine_](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") for architectural
details and administration procedures, and
[Section 10.5, “Optimizing for InnoDB Tables”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimizing-innodb.html "10.5 Optimizing for InnoDB Tables") for performance advice.


In MySQL 5.5 and higher, `InnoDB` is the
default storage engine for new tables and the
`ENGINE=INNODB` clause is not required.


`InnoDB` tables are ideally suited for
**hot backups**. See
[Section 32.1, “MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-enterprise-backup.html "32.1 MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview") for information about
the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product for backing
up MySQL servers without interrupting normal processing.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [storage engine](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_storage_engine), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode

The [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
option controls the algorithm used for
**auto-increment locking**. When
you have an auto-incrementing **primary**
**key**, you can use statement-based replication only
with the setting
[`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=1`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode).
This setting is known as _consecutive_ lock
mode, because multi-row inserts within a transaction receive
consecutive auto-increment values. If you have
[`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode),
which allows higher concurrency for insert operations, use
row-based replication rather than statement-based replication.
This setting is known as _interleaved_ lock
mode, because multiple multi-row insert statements running at
the same time can receive
**auto-increment** values that are
interleaved. The setting
[`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=0`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
should not be used except for compatibility purposes.


Consecutive lock mode
( [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=1`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)) is
the default setting prior to MySQL 8.0.3. As of MySQL 8.0.3,
interleaved lock mode
( [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)) is
the default, which reflects the change from statement-based to
row-based replication as the default replication type.


See Also [auto-increment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_auto_increment), [auto-increment locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_auto_increment_locking), [mixed-mode insert](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mixed_mode_insert), [primary key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_primary_key).

innodb\_file\_per\_table

An important configuration option that affects many aspects of
`InnoDB` file storage, availability of
features, and I/O characteristics. In MySQL 5.6.7 and higher, it
is enabled by default. The
[`innodb_file_per_table`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) option
turns on **file-per-table** mode.
With this mode enabled, a newly created
`InnoDB` table and associated indexes can be
stored in a file-per-table **.ibd**
**file**, outside the **system**
**tablespace**.


This option affects the performance and storage considerations
for a number of SQL statements, such as
[`DROP TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-table.html "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") and
[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/truncate-table.html "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement").


Enabling the
[`innodb_file_per_table`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) option
allows you to take advantage of features such as table
**compression** and named-table
backups in **MySQL Enterprise Backup**.


For more information, see

innodb\_lock\_wait\_timeout

The [`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_lock_wait_timeout)
option sets the balance between
**waiting** for shared resources to
become available, or giving up and handling the error, retrying,
or doing alternative processing in your application. Rolls back
any `InnoDB` transaction that waits more than a
specified time to acquire a
**lock**. Especially useful if
**deadlocks** are caused by updates
to multiple tables controlled by different storage engines; such
deadlocks are not **detected**
automatically.


See Also [deadlock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_deadlock), [deadlock detection](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_deadlock_detection), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [wait](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_wait).

innodb\_strict\_mode

The [`innodb_strict_mode`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) option
controls whether `InnoDB` operates in
**strict mode**, where conditions
that are normally treated as warnings, cause errors instead (and
the underlying statements fail).


See Also [strict mode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_strict_mode).

Innovation Series

Innovation releases with the same major version form an
Innovation series. For example, MySQL 8.1 through 8.3 form the
MySQL 8 Innovation series.


See Also [LTS Series](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lts_series).

insert

One of the primary **DML**
operations in **SQL**. The
performance of inserts is a key factor in
**data warehouse** systems that
load millions of rows into tables, and
**OLTP** systems where many
concurrent connections might insert rows into the same table, in
arbitrary order. If insert performance is important to you, you
should learn about **InnoDB**
features such as the **insert**
**buffer** used in **change**
**buffering**, and
**auto-increment** columns.


See Also [auto-increment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_auto_increment), [change buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffering), [data warehouse](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_warehouse), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb), [insert buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_insert_buffer), [OLTP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_oltp), [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sql).

insert buffer

The former name of the **change**
**buffer**. In MySQL 5.5, support was added for buffering
changes to secondary index pages for
[`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") and
[`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") operations. Previously,
only changes resulting from
[`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations were buffered.
The preferred term is now _change buffer_.


See Also [change buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffer), [change buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffering).

insert buffering

The technique of storing changes to secondary index pages,
resulting from [`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations,
in the **change buffer** rather
than writing the changes immediately, so that the physical
writes can be performed to minimize random I/O. It is one of the
types of **change buffering**; the
others are **delete buffering** and
**purge buffering**.


Insert buffering is not used if the secondary index is
**unique**, because the uniqueness
of new values cannot be verified before the new entries are
written out. Other kinds of change buffering do work for unique
indexes.


See Also [change buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffer), [change buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffering), [delete buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_delete_buffering), [insert buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_insert_buffer), [purge buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_purge_buffering), [unique index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_unique_index).

insert intention lock

A type of **gap lock** that is set
by [`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations prior to row
insertion. This type of **lock**
signals the intent to insert in such a way that multiple
transactions inserting into the same index gap need not wait for
each other if they are not inserting at the same position within
the gap. For more information, see
[Section 17.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-locking.html "17.7.1 InnoDB Locking").


See Also [gap lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_gap_lock), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [next-key lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_next_key_lock).

instance

A single **mysqld** daemon managing
a **data directory** representing
one or more **databases** with a
set of **tables**. It is common in
development, testing, and some
**replication** scenarios to have
multiple instances on the same
**server** machine, each managing
its own data directory and listening on its own port or socket.
With one instance running a
**disk-bound** workload, the server
might still have extra CPU and memory capacity to run additional
instances.


See Also [data directory](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_directory), [database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_database), [disk-bound](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_disk_bound), [mysqld](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqld), [replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replication), [server](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_server), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table).

instrumentation

Modifications at the source code level to collect performance
data for tuning and debugging. In MySQL, data collected by
instrumentation is exposed through an SQL interface using the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` and
`PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA` databases.


See Also [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_information_schema), [Performance Schema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_performance_schema).

intention exclusive lock

See [intention lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_intention_lock).

intention lock

A kind of **lock** that applies to
the table, used to indicate the kind of lock the
**transaction** intends to acquire
on rows in the table. Different transactions can acquire
different kinds of intention locks on the same table, but the
first transaction to acquire an _intention_
_exclusive_ (IX) lock on a table prevents other
transactions from acquiring any S or X locks on the table.
Conversely, the first transaction to acquire an
_intention shared_ (IS) lock on a table
prevents other transactions from acquiring any X locks on the
table. The two-phase process allows the lock requests to be
resolved in order, without blocking locks and corresponding
operations that are compatible. For more information about this
locking mechanism, see [Section 17.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-locking.html "17.7.1 InnoDB Locking").


See Also [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [lock mode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock_mode), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

intention shared lock

See [intention lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_intention_lock).

interceptor

Code for instrumenting or debugging some aspect of an
application, which can be enabled without recompiling or
changing the source of the application itself.


See Also [command interceptor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_command_interceptor), [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_net), [exception interceptor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_exception_interceptor).

intrinsic temporary table

An optimized internal `InnoDB` temporary table
used by the _optimizer_.


See Also [optimizer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_optimizer).

inverted index

A data structure optimized for document retrieval systems, used
in the implementation of `InnoDB` **full-text search**. The
`InnoDB` **FULLTEXT**
**index**, implemented as an inverted index, records the
position of each word within a document, rather than the
location of a table row. A single column value (a document
stored as a text string) is represented by many entries in the
inverted index.


See Also [full-text search](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_full_text_search), [FULLTEXT index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fulltext_index), [ilist](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ilist).

IOPS

Acronym for **I/O operations per**
**second**. A common measurement for busy systems,
particularly **OLTP** applications.
If this value is near the maximum that the storage devices can
handle, the application can become
**disk-bound**, limiting
**scalability**.


See Also [disk-bound](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_disk_bound), [OLTP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_oltp), [scalability](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_scalability).

isolation level

One of the foundations of database processing. Isolation is the
**I** in the acronym
**ACID**; the isolation level is
the setting that fine-tunes the balance between performance and
reliability, consistency, and reproducibility of results when
multiple **transactions** are
making changes and performing queries at the same time.


From highest amount of consistency and protection to the least,
the isolation levels supported by InnoDB are:
**SERIALIZABLE**,
**REPEATABLE READ**,
**READ COMMITTED**, and
**READ UNCOMMITTED**.


With `InnoDB` tables, many users can keep the
default isolation level (_REPEATABLE READ_)
for all operations. Expert users might choose the
**READ COMMITTED** level as they
push the boundaries of scalability with
**OLTP** processing, or during data
warehousing operations where minor inconsistencies do not affect
the aggregate results of large amounts of data. The levels on
the edges (**SERIALIZABLE** and
**READ UNCOMMITTED**) change the
processing behavior to such an extent that they are rarely used.

See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [OLTP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_oltp), [READ COMMITTED](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_committed), [READ UNCOMMITTED](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_uncommitted), [REPEATABLE READ](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_repeatable_read), [SERIALIZABLE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_serializable), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

### J

J2EE

Java Platform, Enterprise Edition: Oracle's enterprise Java
platform. It consists of an API and a runtime environment for
enterprise-class Java applications. For full details, see
[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html).
With MySQL applications, you typically use
**Connector/J** for database
access, and an application server such as
**Tomcat** or
**JBoss** to handle the middle-tier
work, and optionally a framework such as
**Spring**. Database-related
features often offered within a J2EE stack include a
**connection pool** and
**failover** support.


See Also [connection pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connection_pool), [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [failover](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_failover), [Java](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_java), [JBoss](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_jboss), [Spring](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_spring), [Tomcat](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_tomcat).

Java

A programming language combining high performance, rich built-in
features and data types, object-oriented mechanisms, extensive
standard library, and wide range of reusable third-party
modules. Enterprise development is supported by many frameworks,
application servers, and other technologies. Much of its syntax
is familiar to **C** and
**C++** developers. To write Java
applications with MySQL, you use the
**JDBC** driver known as
**Connector/J**.


See Also [C](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_c), [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [C++](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cplusplus), [JDBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_jdbc).

JBoss

See Also [J2EE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_j2ee).

JDBC

Abbreviation for “Java Database Connectivity”, an
**API** for database access from
**Java** applications. Java
developers writing MySQL applications use the
**Connector/J** component as their
JDBC driver.


See Also [API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_api), [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [J2EE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_j2ee), [Java](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_java).

JNDI

See Also [Java](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_java).

join

A **query** that retrieves data
from more than one table, by referencing columns in the tables
that hold identical values. Ideally, these columns are part of
an `InnoDB` **foreign**
**key** relationship, which ensures
**referential integrity** and that
the join columns are **indexed**.
Often used to save space and improve query performance by
replacing repeated strings with numeric IDs, in a
**normalized** data design.

See Also [foreign key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_foreign_key), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [normalized](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_normalized), [query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query), [referential integrity](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_referential_integrity).

### K

KDC

See [key distribution center](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_key_distribution_center).

key distribution center

In Kerberos, the key distribution center comprises an
authentication server (AS) and a ticket-granting server (TGS).


See Also [authentication server](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_authentication_server), [ticket-granting ticket](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ticket_granting_ticket).

keystore

See Also [SSL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ssl).

KEY\_BLOCK\_SIZE

An option to specify the size of data pages within an
`InnoDB` table that uses
**compressed row format**. The
default is 8 kilobytes. Lower values risk hitting internal
limits that depend on the combination of row size and
compression percentage.


For [`MyISAM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/myisam-storage-engine.html "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables,
`KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` optionally specifies the size
in bytes to use for index key blocks. The value is treated as a
hint; a different size could be used if necessary. A
`KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` value specified for an
individual index definition overrides a table-level
`KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` value.

See Also [compressed row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compressed_row_format).

### L

latch

A lightweight structure used by `InnoDB` to
implement a **lock** for its own
internal memory structures, typically held for a brief time
measured in milliseconds or microseconds. A general term that
includes both **mutexes** (for
exclusive access) and **rw-locks**
(for shared access). Certain latches are the focus of
`InnoDB` performance tuning. Statistics about
latch use and contention are available through the
**Performance Schema** interface.


See Also [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [mutex](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mutex), [Performance Schema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_performance_schema), [rw-lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rw_lock).

libmysql

Informal name for the
**libmysqlclient** library.


See Also [libmysqlclient](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_libmysqlclient).

libmysqlclient

The library file, named `libmysqlclient.a` or
`libmysqlclient.so`, that is typically linked
into **client** programs written in
**C**. Sometimes known informally
as **libmysql** or the
**mysqlclient** library.


See Also [client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_client), [libmysql](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_libmysql), [mysqlclient](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqlclient).

libmysqld

This **embedded** MySQL server
library makes it possible to run a full-featured MySQL server
inside a **client** application.
The main benefits are increased speed and more simple management
for embedded applications. You link with the
`libmysqld` library rather than
**libmysqlclient**. The API is
identical between all three of these libraries.


See Also [client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_client), [embedded](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_embedded), [libmysql](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_libmysql), [libmysqlclient](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_libmysqlclient).

lifecycle interceptor

A type of **interceptor** supported
by **Connector/J**. It involves
implementing the interface
`com.mysql.jdbc.ConnectionLifecycleInterceptor`.


See Also [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [interceptor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_interceptor).

list

The `InnoDB` **buffer**
**pool** is represented as a list of memory
**pages**. The list is reordered as
new pages are accessed and enter the buffer pool, as pages
within the buffer pool are accessed again and are considered
newer, and as pages that are not accessed for a long time are
**evicted** from the buffer pool.
The buffer pool is divided into
**sublists**, and the replacement
policy is a variation of the familiar
**LRU** technique.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [eviction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_eviction), [LRU](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lru), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page), [sublist](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sublist).

load balancing

A technique for scaling read-only connections by sending query
requests to different slave servers in a replication or Cluster
configuration. With
**Connector/J**, load balancing is
enabled through the
`com.mysql.jdbc.ReplicationDriver` class and
controlled by the configuration property
`loadBalanceStrategy`.


See Also [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [J2EE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_j2ee).

localhost

See Also [connection](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connection).

lock

The high-level notion of an object that controls access to a
resource, such as a table, row, or internal data structure, as
part of a **locking** strategy. For
intensive performance tuning, you might delve into the actual
structures that implement locks, such as
**mutexes** and
**latches**.


See Also [latch](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_latch), [lock mode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock_mode), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [mutex](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mutex).

lock escalation

An operation used in some database systems that converts many
**row locks** into a single
**table lock**, saving memory space
but reducing concurrent access to the table.
`InnoDB` uses a space-efficient representation
for row locks, so that **lock**
escalation is not needed.


See Also [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [row lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_lock), [table lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table_lock).

lock mode

A shared (S) **lock** allows a
**transaction** to read a row.
Multiple transactions can acquire an S lock on that same row at
the same time.


An exclusive (X) lock allows a transaction to update or delete a
row. No other transaction can acquire any kind of lock on that
same row at the same time.


**Intention locks** apply to the
table, and are used to indicate what kind of lock the
transaction intends to acquire on rows in the table. Different
transactions can acquire different kinds of intention locks on
the same table, but the first transaction to acquire an
intention exclusive (IX) lock on a table prevents other
transactions from acquiring any S or X locks on the table.
Conversely, the first transaction to acquire an intention shared
(IS) lock on a table prevents other transactions from acquiring
any X locks on the table. The two-phase process allows the lock
requests to be resolved in order, without blocking locks and
corresponding operations that are compatible.


See Also [intention lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_intention_lock), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

locking

The system of protecting a
**transaction** from seeing or
changing data that is being queried or changed by other
transactions. The **locking**
strategy must balance reliability and consistency of database
operations (the principles of the
**ACID** philosophy) against the
performance needed for good
**concurrency**. Fine-tuning the
locking strategy often involves choosing an
**isolation level** and ensuring
all your database operations are safe and reliable for that
isolation level.

locking read

A [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement that also
performs a **locking** operation on
an `InnoDB` table. Either `SELECT ...
        FOR UPDATE` or `SELECT ...
        LOCK IN SHARE MODE`. It has the potential to produce a
**deadlock**, depending on the
**isolation level** of the
transaction. The opposite of a **non-locking**
**read**. Not allowed for global tables in a
**read-only transaction**.


`SELECT ... FOR SHARE` replaces `SELECT
        ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` in MySQL 8.0.1, but
`LOCK IN SHARE MODE` remains available for
backward compatibility.


See [Section 17.7.2.4, “Locking Reads”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-locking-reads.html "17.7.2.4 Locking Reads").

log

In the `InnoDB` context, “log” or
“log files” typically refers to the
**redo log** represented by the
**ib\_logfile _`N`_**
files. Another type of `InnoDB` log is the
**undo log**, which is a storage
area that holds copies of data modified by active transactions.


Other kinds of logs that are important in MySQL are the
**error log** (for diagnosing
startup and runtime problems), **binary**
**log** (for working with replication and performing
point-in-time restores), the **general query**
**log** (for diagnosing application problems), and the
**slow query log** (for diagnosing
performance problems).


See Also [binary log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_binary_log), [error log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_error_log), [general query log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_general_query_log), [ib\_logfile](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ib_logfile), [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log), [slow query log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_slow_query_log), [undo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log).

log buffer

The memory area that holds data to be written to the
**log files** that make up the
**redo log**. It is controlled by
the [`innodb_log_buffer_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_log_buffer_size)
configuration option.


See Also [log file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_log_file), [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log).

log file

One of the
**ib\_logfile _`N`_**
files that make up the **redo**
**log**. Data is written to these files from the
**log buffer** memory area.


See Also [ib\_logfile](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ib_logfile), [log buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_log_buffer), [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log).

log group

The set of files that make up the **redo**
**log**, typically named `ib_logfile0`
and `ib_logfile1`. (For that reason, sometimes
referred to collectively as
**ib\_logfile**.)


See Also [ib\_logfile](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ib_logfile), [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log).

logical

A type of operation that involves high-level, abstract aspects
such as tables, queries, indexes, and other SQL concepts.
Typically, logical aspects are important to make database
administration and application development convenient and
usable. Contrast with **physical**.


See Also [logical backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_logical_backup), [physical](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_physical).

logical backup

A **backup** that reproduces table
structure and data, without copying the actual data files. For
example, the
**`mysqldump`**
command produces a logical backup, because its output contains
statements such as [`CREATE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table.html "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
and [`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") that can re-create the
data. Contrast with **physical**
**backup**. A logical backup offers flexibility (for
example, you could edit table definitions or insert statements
before restoring), but can take substantially longer to
**restore** than a physical backup.


See Also [backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_backup), [mysqldump](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqldump), [physical backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_physical_backup), [restore](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_restore).

loose\_

A prefix added to `InnoDB` configuration
options after server **startup**,
so any new configuration options not recognized by the current
level of MySQL do not cause a startup failure. MySQL processes
configuration options that start with this prefix, but gives a
warning rather than a failure if the part after the prefix is
not a recognized option.


See Also [startup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_startup).

low-water mark

A value representing a lower limit, typically a threshold value
at which some corrective action begins or becomes more
aggressive. Contrast with **high-water**
**mark**.


See Also [high-water mark](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_high_water_mark).

LRU

An acronym for “least recently used”, a common
method for managing storage areas. The items that have not been
used recently are **evicted** when
space is needed to cache newer items. `InnoDB`
uses the LRU mechanism by default to manage the
**pages** within the
**buffer pool**, but makes
exceptions in cases where a page might be read only a single
time, such as during a **full table**
**scan**. This variation of the LRU algorithm is called
the **midpoint insertion**
**strategy**. For more information, see
[Section 17.5.1, “Buffer Pool”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-buffer-pool.html "17.5.1 Buffer Pool").


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [eviction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_eviction), [full table scan](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_full_table_scan), [midpoint insertion strategy](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_midpoint_insertion_strategy), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page).

LSN

Acronym for “log sequence number”. This arbitrary,
ever-increasing value represents a point in time corresponding
to operations recorded in the **redo**
**log**. (This point in time is regardless of
**transaction** boundaries; it can
fall in the middle of one or more transactions.) It is used
internally by `InnoDB` during
**crash recovery** and for managing
the **buffer pool**.


Prior to MySQL 5.6.3, the LSN was a 4-byte unsigned integer. The
LSN became an 8-byte unsigned integer in MySQL 5.6.3 when the
redo log file size limit increased from 4GB to 512GB, as
additional bytes were required to store extra size information.
Applications built on MySQL 5.6.3 or later that use LSN values
should use 64-bit rather than 32-bit variables to store and
compare LSN values.


In the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, you can
specify an LSN to represent the point in time from which to take
an **incremental backup**. The
relevant LSN is displayed by the output of the
**mysqlbackup** command. Once you have the LSN
corresponding to the time of a full backup, you can specify that
value to take a subsequent incremental backup, whose output
contains another LSN for the next incremental backup.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [crash recovery](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_crash_recovery), [incremental backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_incremental_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

LTS Series

LTS releases with the same major version number form an LTS
series. For example, all MySQL 8.4.x releases form the MySQL 8.4
LTS series.


Note: MySQL 8.0 is a Bugfix series that preceded the LTS release
model.

See Also [Innovation Series](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innovation_series).

### M

.MRG file

A file containing references to other tables, used by the
`MERGE` storage engine. Files with this
extension are always included in backups produced by the
**mysqlbackup** command of the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product.


See Also [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

.MYD file

A file that MySQL uses to store data for a
[`MyISAM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/myisam-storage-engine.html "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") table.


See Also [.MYI file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_myi_file), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

.MYI file

A file that MySQL uses to store indexes for a
[`MyISAM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/myisam-storage-engine.html "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") table.


See Also [.MYD file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_myd_file), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

master

See [source](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_source).

master thread

An `InnoDB` **thread** that performs various
tasks in the background. Most of these tasks are I/O related,
such as writing changes from the **change**
**buffer** to the appropriate secondary indexes.


To improve **concurrency**,
sometimes actions are moved from the master thread to separate
background threads. For example, in MySQL 5.6 and higher,
**dirty pages** are
**flushed** from the
**buffer pool** by the
**page cleaner** thread rather than
the master thread.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [change buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffer), [concurrency](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_concurrency), [dirty page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dirty_page), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [page cleaner](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page_cleaner), [thread](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_thread).

MDL

Acronym for “metadata lock”.


See Also [metadata lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_metadata_lock).

medium trust

Synonym for **partial trust**.
Because the range of trust settings is so broad, “partial
trust” is preferred, to avoid the implication that there
are only three levels (low, medium, and full).


See Also [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_net), [partial trust](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_partial_trust).

memcached

A popular component of many MySQL and
**NoSQL** software stacks, allowing
fast reads and writes for single values and caching the results
entirely in memory. Traditionally, applications required extra
logic to write the same data to a MySQL database for permanent
storage, or to read data from a MySQL database when it was not
cached yet in memory. Now, applications can use the simple
**memcached** protocol, supported by client
libraries for many languages, to communicate directly with MySQL
servers using `InnoDB` or
`NDB` tables. These NoSQL interfaces to MySQL
tables allow applications to achieve higher read and write
performance than by issuing SQL statements directly, and can
simplify application logic and deployment configurations for
systems that already incorporate **memcached**
for in-memory caching.


See Also [NoSQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_nosql).

merge

To apply changes to data cached in memory, such as when a page
is brought into the **buffer**
**pool**, and any applicable changes recorded in the
**change buffer** are incorporated
into the page in the buffer pool. The updated data is eventually
written to the **tablespace** by
the **flush** mechanism.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [change buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffer), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_tablespace).

metadata lock

A type of **lock** that prevents
**DDL** operations on a table that
is being used at the same time by another
**transaction**. For details, see
[Section 10.11.4, “Metadata Locking”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/metadata-locking.html "10.11.4 Metadata Locking").


Enhancements to **online**
operations, particularly in MySQL 5.6 and higher, are focused on
reducing the amount of metadata locking. The objective is for
DDL operations that do not change the table structure (such as
[`CREATE INDEX`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-index.html "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement") and
[`DROP INDEX`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-index.html "15.1.27 DROP INDEX Statement") for
`InnoDB` tables) to proceed while the table is
being queried, updated, and so on by other transactions.


See Also [DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ddl), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [online](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_online), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

metrics counter

A feature implemented by the
[`INNODB_METRICS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-innodb-metrics-table.html "28.4.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_METRICS Table") table in the
**INFORMATION\_SCHEMA**, in MySQL
5.6 and higher. You can query
**counts** and totals for low-level
`InnoDB` operations, and use the results for
performance tuning in combination with data from the
**Performance Schema**.


See Also [counter](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_counter), [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_information_schema), [Performance Schema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_performance_schema).

midpoint insertion strategy

The technique of initially bringing
**pages** into the
`InnoDB` **buffer**
**pool** not at the “newest” end of the
list, but instead somewhere in the middle. The exact location of
this point can vary, based on the setting of the
[`innodb_old_blocks_pct`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_old_blocks_pct) option.
The intent is that pages that are only read once, such as during
a **full table scan**, can be aged
out of the buffer pool sooner than with a strict
**LRU** algorithm. For more
information, see [Section 17.5.1, “Buffer Pool”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-buffer-pool.html "17.5.1 Buffer Pool").


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [full table scan](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_full_table_scan), [LRU](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lru), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page).

mini-transaction

An internal phase of `InnoDB` processing, when
making changes at the **physical**
level to internal data structures during
**DML** operations. A
mini-transaction (mtr) has no notion of
**rollback**; multiple
mini-transactions can occur within a single
**transaction**. Mini-transactions
write information to the **redo**
**log** that is used during **crash**
**recovery**. A mini-transaction can also happen outside
the context of a regular transaction, for example during
**purge** processing by background
threads.


See Also [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [crash recovery](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_crash_recovery), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [physical](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_physical), [purge](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_purge), [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log), [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

mixed-mode insert

An [`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement where
**auto-increment** values are
specified for some but not all of the new rows. For example, a
multi-value `INSERT` could specify a value for
the auto-increment column in some cases and
`NULL` in other cases.
`InnoDB` generates auto-increment values for
the rows where the column value was specified as
`NULL`. Another example is an
[`INSERT ...\\
        ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert-on-duplicate.html "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") statement, where
auto-increment values might be generated but not used, for any
duplicate rows that are processed as `UPDATE`
rather than `INSERT` statements.


Can cause consistency issues between
**source** and
**replica** servers in a
**replication** configuration. Can
require adjusting the value of the
**innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode**
configuration option.


See Also [auto-increment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_auto_increment), [innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode), [replica](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replica), [replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replication), [source](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_source).

**Connector/J** when it was
integrated with the MySQL product.

multi-core

A type of processor that can take advantage of multithreaded
programs, such as the MySQL server.


multiversion concurrency control

See [MVCC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mvcc).

mutex

Informal abbreviation for “mutex variable”. (Mutex
itself is short for “mutual exclusion”.) The
low-level object that `InnoDB` uses to
represent and enforce exclusive-access
**locks** to internal in-memory
data structures. Once the lock is acquired, any other process,
thread, and so on is prevented from acquiring the same lock.
Contrast with **rw-locks**, which
`InnoDB` uses to represent and enforce
shared-access **locks** to internal
in-memory data structures. Mutexes and rw-locks are known
collectively as **latches**.


See Also [latch](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_latch), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [Performance Schema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_performance_schema), [Pthreads](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_pthreads), [rw-lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rw_lock).

MVCC

Acronym for “multiversion concurrency control”.
This technique lets `InnoDB` **transactions** with certain
**isolation levels** perform
**consistent read** operations;
that is, to query rows that are being updated by other
transactions, and see the values from before those updates
occurred. This is a powerful technique to increase
**concurrency**, by allowing
queries to proceed without waiting due to
**locks** held by the other
transactions.


This technique is not universal in the database world. Some
other database products, and some other MySQL storage engines,
do not support it.

**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product. It performs a
**hot backup** operation for
[`InnoDB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables, and a
[warm backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_warm_backup "warm backup") for
[`MyISAM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/myisam-storage-engine.html "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") and other kinds of tables.
See [Section 32.1, “MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-enterprise-backup.html "32.1 MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview") for more
information about this command.

mysqlclient

The informal name for the library that is implemented by the
file **libmysqlclient**, with
extension `.a` or `.so`.


See Also [libmysqlclient](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_libmysqlclient).

mysqld

[**mysqld**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld.html "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), also known as MySQL Server, is a
single multithreaded program that does most of the work in a
MySQL installation. It does not spawn additional processes.
MySQL Server manages access to the MySQL data directory that
contains databases, tables, and other information such as log
files and status files.


[**mysqld**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld.html "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") runs as a Unix daemon or Windows
service, constantly waiting for requests and performing
maintenance work in the background.


See Also [instance](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_instance), [mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql).

MySQLdb

The name of the open-source
**Python** module that forms the
basis of the MySQL **Python API**.


See Also [Python](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_python), [Python API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_python_api).

mysqldump

A command that performs a **logical**
**backup** of some combination of databases, tables, and
table data. The results are SQL statements that reproduce the
original schema objects, data, or both. For substantial amounts
of data, a **physical backup**
solution such as **MySQL Enterprise Backup** is
faster, particularly for the
**restore** operation.

See Also [logical backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_logical_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [physical backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_physical_backup), [restore](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_restore).

### N

.NET

See Also [ADO.NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ado_net), [ASP.net](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_asp_net), [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_net), [Mono](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mono), [Visual Studio](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_visual_studio).

native C API

Synonym for **libmysqlclient**.


See Also [libmysql](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_libmysql).

natural key

An indexed column, typically a **primary**
**key**, where the values have some real-world
significance. Usually advised against because:

- If the value should ever change, there is potentially a lot
of index maintenance to re-sort the
**clustered index** and update
the copies of the primary key value that are repeated in
each **secondary index**.


- Even seemingly stable values can change in unpredictable
ways that are difficult to represent correctly in the
database. For example, one country can change into two or
several, making the original country code obsolete. Or,
rules about unique values might have exceptions. For
example, even if taxpayer IDs are intended to be unique to a
single person, a database might have to handle records that
violate that rule, such as in cases of identity theft.
Taxpayer IDs and other sensitive ID numbers also make poor
primary keys, because they may need to be secured,
encrypted, and otherwise treated differently than other
columns.


Thus, it is typically better to use arbitrary numeric values to
form a **synthetic key**, for
example using an **auto-increment**
column.


See Also [auto-increment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_auto_increment), [clustered index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_clustered_index), [primary key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_primary_key), [secondary index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_secondary_index), [synthetic key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_synthetic_key).

neighbor page

Any **page** in the same
**extent** as a particular page.
When a page is selected to be
**flushed**, any neighbor pages
that are **dirty** are typically
flushed as well, as an I/O optimization for traditional hard
disks. In MySQL 5.6 and up, this behavior can be controlled by
the configuration variable
[`innodb_flush_neighbors`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_flush_neighbors); you
might turn that setting off for SSD drives, which do not have
the same overhead for writing smaller batches of data at random
locations.


See Also [dirty page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dirty_page), [extent](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_extent), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page).

next-key lock

A combination of a **record lock**
on the index record and a [gap\\
lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_gap_lock "gap lock") on the gap before the index record.


See Also [gap lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_gap_lock), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [record lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_record_lock).

non-locking read

A **query** that does not use the
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` or `SELECT ...
        LOCK IN SHARE MODE` clauses. The only kind of query
allowed for global tables in a **read-only**
**transaction**. The opposite of a
**locking read**. See
[Section 17.7.2.3, “Consistent Nonlocking Reads”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-consistent-read.html "17.7.2.3 Consistent Nonlocking Reads").


`SELECT ... FOR SHARE` replaces `SELECT
        ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` in MySQL 8.0.1, but
`LOCK IN SHARE MODE` remains available for
backward compatibility.


See Also [locking read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking_read), [query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query), [read-only transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_only_transaction).

non-repeatable read

The situation when a query retrieves data, and a later query
within the same **transaction**
retrieves what should be the same data, but the queries return
different results (changed by another transaction committing in
the meantime).


This kind of operation goes against the
**ACID** principle of database
design. Within a transaction, data should be consistent, with
predictable and stable relationships.


Among different **isolation**
**levels**, non-repeatable reads are prevented by the
**serializable read** and
**repeatable read** levels, and
allowed by the **consistent read**,
and **read uncommitted** levels.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [consistent read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [READ UNCOMMITTED](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_uncommitted), [REPEATABLE READ](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_repeatable_read), [SERIALIZABLE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_serializable), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

nonblocking I/O

An industry term that means the same as
**asynchronous I/O**.


See Also [asynchronous I/O](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_asynchronous_io).

normalized

A database design strategy where data is split into multiple
tables, and duplicate values condensed into single rows
represented by an ID, to avoid storing, querying, and updating
redundant or lengthy values. It is typically used in
**OLTP** applications.


For example, an address might be given a unique ID, so that a
census database could represent the relationship
**lives at this address** by
associating that ID with each member of a family, rather than
storing multiple copies of a complex value such as
**123 Main Street, Anytown, USA**.


For another example, although a simple address book application
might store each phone number in the same table as a person's
name and address, a phone company database might give each phone
number a special ID, and store the numbers and IDs in a separate
table. This normalized representation could simplify large-scale
updates when area codes split apart.


Normalization is not always recommended. Data that is primarily
queried, and only updated by deleting entirely and reloading, is
often kept in fewer, larger tables with redundant copies of
duplicate values. This data representation is referred to as
**denormalized**, and is frequently
found in data warehousing applications.


See Also [denormalized](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_denormalized), [foreign key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_foreign_key), [OLTP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_oltp), [relational](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_relational).

NoSQL

A broad term for a set of data access technologies that do not
use the **SQL** language as their
primary mechanism for reading and writing data. Some NoSQL
technologies act as key-value stores, only accepting
single-value reads and writes; some relax the restrictions of
the **ACID** methodology; still
others do not require a pre-planned
**schema**. MySQL users can combine
NoSQL-style processing for speed and simplicity with SQL
operations for flexibility and convenience, by using the
**memcached** API to directly
access some kinds of MySQL tables.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [memcached](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_memcached), [schema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_schema), [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sql).

NOT NULL constraint

A type of **constraint** that
specifies that a **column** cannot
contain any **NULL** values. It
helps to preserve **referential**
**integrity**, as the database server can identify data
with erroneous missing values. It also helps in the arithmetic
involved in query optimization, allowing the optimizer to
predict the number of entries in an index on that column.


See Also [column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_column), [constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_constraint), [NULL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_null), [primary key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_primary_key), [referential integrity](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_referential_integrity).

NULL

A special value in **SQL**,
indicating the absence of data. Any arithmetic operation or
equality test involving a `NULL` value, in turn
produces a `NULL` result. (Thus it is similar
to the IEEE floating-point concept of NaN, “not a
number”.) Any aggregate calculation such as
`AVG()` ignores rows with
`NULL` values, when determining how many rows
to divide by. The only test that works with
`NULL` values uses the SQL idioms `IS
        NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`.


`NULL` values play a part in
**index** operations, because for
performance a database must minimize the overhead of keeping
track of missing data values. Typically, `NULL`
values are not stored in an index, because a query that tests an
indexed column using a standard comparison operator could never
match a row with a `NULL` value for that
column. For the same reason, unique indexes do not prevent
`NULL` values; those values simply are not
represented in the index. Declaring a `NOT
        NULL` constraint on a column provides reassurance that
there are no rows left out of the index, allowing for better
query optimization (accurate counting of rows and estimation of
whether to use the index).


Because the **primary key** must be
able to uniquely identify every row in the table, a
single-column primary key cannot contain any
`NULL` values, and a multi-column primary key
cannot contain any rows with `NULL` values in
all columns.


Although the Oracle database allows a `NULL`
value to be concatenated with a string,
`InnoDB` treats the result of such an operation
as `NULL`.

### O

.OPT file

A file containing database configuration information. Files with
this extension are included in backups produced by the
**mysqlbackup** command of the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product.


See Also [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

ODBC

Acronym for Open Database Connectivity, an industry-standard
API. Typically used with Windows-based servers, or applications
that require ODBC to communicate with MySQL. The MySQL ODBC
driver is called
**Connector/ODBC**.


See Also [Connector/ODBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_odbc).

off-page column

A column containing variable-length data (such as
[`BLOB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
[`VARCHAR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/char.html "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")) that is too long to fit
on a **B-tree** page. The data is
stored in **overflow pages**. The
**DYNAMIC** row format is more
efficient for such storage than the older
**COMPACT** row format.


See Also [B-tree](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_b_tree), [compact row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compact_row_format), [dynamic row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dynamic_row_format), [overflow page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_overflow_page).

OLTP

Acronym for “Online Transaction Processing”. A
database system, or a database application, that runs a workload
with many **transactions**, with
frequent writes as well as reads, typically affecting small
amounts of data at a time. For example, an airline reservation
system or an application that processes bank deposits. The data
might be organized in
**normalized** form for a balance
between **DML**
(insert/update/delete) efficiency and
**query** efficiency. Contrast with
**data warehouse**.


With its **row-level locking** and
**transactional** capability,
**InnoDB** is the ideal storage
engine for MySQL tables used in OLTP applications.


See Also [data warehouse](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_warehouse), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb), [query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query), [row lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_lock), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

online

A type of operation that involves no downtime, blocking, or
restricted operation for the database. Typically applied to
**DDL**. Operations that shorten
the periods of restricted operation, such as
**fast index creation**, have
evolved into a wider set of **online**
**DDL** operations in MySQL 5.6.


In the context of backups, a **hot**
**backup** is an online operation and a
**warm backup** is partially an
online operation.


See Also [DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ddl), [Fast Index Creation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fast_index_creation), [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup), [online DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_online_ddl), [warm backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_warm_backup).

online DDL

A feature that improves the performance, concurrency, and
availability of `InnoDB` tables during
**DDL** (primarily
[`ALTER TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")) operations. See
[Section 17.12, “InnoDB and Online DDL”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-online-ddl.html "17.12 InnoDB and Online DDL") for details.


The details vary according to the type of operation. In some
cases, the table can be modified concurrently while the
[`ALTER TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is in progress. The
operation might be able to be performed without a table copy, or
using a specially optimized type of table copy. DML log space
usage for in-place operations is controlled by the
[`innodb_online_alter_log_max_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_online_alter_log_max_size)
configuration option.


This feature is an enhancement of the **Fast**
**Index Creation** feature in MySQL 5.5.


See Also [DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ddl), [Fast Index Creation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fast_index_creation), [online](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_online).

optimistic

A methodology that guides low-level implementation decisions for
a relational database system. The requirements of performance
and **concurrency** in a relational
database mean that operations must be started or dispatched
quickly. The requirements of consistency and
**referential integrity** mean that
any operation could fail: a transaction might be rolled back, a
**DML** operation could violate a
constraint, a request for a lock could cause a deadlock, a
network error could cause a timeout. An optimistic strategy is
one that assumes most requests or attempts succeed, so that
relatively little work is done to prepare for the failure case.
When this assumption is true, the database does little
unnecessary work; when requests do fail, extra work must be done
to clean up and undo changes.


`InnoDB` uses optimistic strategies for
operations such as **locking** and
**commits**. For example, data
changed by a transaction can be written to the data files before
the commit occurs, making the commit itself very fast, but
requiring more work to undo the changes if the transaction is
rolled back.


The opposite of an optimistic strategy is a
**pessimistic** one, where a system
is optimized to deal with operations that are unreliable and
frequently unsuccessful. This methodology is rare in a database
system, because so much care goes into choosing reliable
hardware, networks, and algorithms.


See Also [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [concurrency](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_concurrency), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [pessimistic](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_pessimistic), [referential integrity](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_referential_integrity).

optimizer

The MySQL component that determines the best
**indexes** and
**join** order to use for a
**query**, based on characteristics
and data distribution of the relevant
**tables**.


See Also [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [join](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_join), [query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table).

option

A configuration parameter for MySQL, either stored in the
**option file** or passed on the
command line.


For the **options** that apply to
**InnoDB** tables, each option name
starts with the prefix `innodb_`.


See Also [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb), [option](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_option), [option file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_option_file).

option file

The file that holds the configuration
**options** for the MySQL instance.
Traditionally, on Linux and Unix this file is named
`my.cnf`, and on Windows it is named
`my.ini`.


See Also [configuration file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_configuration_file), [my.cnf](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_my_cnf), [my.ini](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_my_ini), [option](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_option).

overflow page

Separately allocated disk **pages**
that hold variable-length columns (such as
`BLOB` and `VARCHAR`) that are
too long to fit on a **B-tree**
page. The associated columns are known as
**off-page columns**.

See Also [B-tree](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_b_tree), [off-page column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_off_page_column), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page).

### P

.par file

A file containing partition definitions. Files with this
extension are included in backups produced by the
`mysqlbackup` command of the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product.


With the introduction of native partitioning support for
`InnoDB` tables in MySQL 5.7.6,
`.par` files are no longer created for
partitioned `InnoDB` tables. Partitioned
`MyISAM` tables continue to use
`.par` files in MySQL 5.7. In MySQL 8.0,
partitioning support is only provided by the
`InnoDB` storage engine. As such,
`.par` files are no longer used as of MySQL
8.0.


See Also [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

page

A unit representing how much data `InnoDB`
transfers at any one time between disk (the
**data files**) and memory (the
**buffer pool**). A page can
contain one or more **rows**,
depending on how much data is in each row. If a row does not fit
entirely into a single page, `InnoDB` sets up
additional pointer-style data structures so that the information
about the row can be stored in one page.


One way to fit more data in each page is to use
**compressed row format**. For
tables that use BLOBs or large text fields,
**compact row format** allows those
large columns to be stored separately from the rest of the row,
reducing I/O overhead and memory usage for queries that do not
reference those columns.


When `InnoDB` reads or writes sets of pages as
a batch to increase I/O throughput, it reads or writes an
**extent** at a time.


All the `InnoDB` disk data structures within a
MySQL instance share the same **page**
**size**.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [compact row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compact_row_format), [compressed row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compressed_row_format), [data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files), [extent](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_extent), [page size](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page_size), [row](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row).

page cleaner

An `InnoDB` background
**thread** that
**flushes****dirty pages** from the
**buffer pool**. Prior to MySQL
5.6, this activity was performed by the
**master thread**. The number of
page cleaner threads is controlled by the
[`innodb_page_cleaners`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_page_cleaners)
configuration option, introduced in MySQL 5.7.4.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [dirty page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dirty_page), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [master thread](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_master_thread), [thread](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_thread).

page size

For releases up to and including MySQL 5.5, the size of each
`InnoDB` **page**
is fixed at 16 kilobytes. This value represents a balance: large
enough to hold the data for most rows, yet small enough to
minimize the performance overhead of transferring unneeded data
to memory. Other values are not tested or supported.


Starting in MySQL 5.6, the page size for an
`InnoDB` **instance** can be either 4KB,
8KB, or 16KB, controlled by the
[`innodb_page_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_page_size) configuration
option. As of MySQL 5.7.6, `InnoDB` also
supports 32KB and 64KB page sizes. For 32KB and 64KB page sizes,
`ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED` is not supported and
the maximum record size is 16KB.


Page size is set when creating the MySQL instance, and it
remains constant afterward. The same page size applies to all
`InnoDB` **tablespaces**, including the
**system tablespace**,
**file-per-table** tablespaces, and
**general tablespaces**.


Smaller page sizes can help performance with storage devices
that use small block sizes, particularly for
**SSD** devices in
**disk-bound** workloads, such as
for **OLTP** applications. As
individual rows are updated, less data is copied into memory,
written to disk, reorganized, locked, and so on.


See Also [disk-bound](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_disk_bound), [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [general tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_general_tablespace), [instance](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_instance), [OLTP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_oltp), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page), [SSD](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ssd), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace), [tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_tablespace).

parent table

The table in a **foreign key**
relationship that holds the initial column values pointed to
from the **child table**. The
consequences of deleting, or updating rows in the parent table
depend on the `ON UPDATE` and `ON
        DELETE` clauses in the foreign key definition. Rows
with corresponding values in the child table could be
automatically deleted or updated in turn, or those columns could
be set to `NULL`, or the operation could be
prevented.


See Also [child table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_child_table), [foreign key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_foreign_key).

partial backup

A **backup** that contains some of
the **tables** in a MySQL database,
or some of the databases in a MySQL instance. Contrast with
**full backup**.


See Also [backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_backup), [full backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_full_backup), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table).

partial index

An **index** that represents only
part of a column value, typically the first N characters (the
**prefix**) of a long
`VARCHAR` value.


See Also [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [index prefix](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index_prefix).

partial trust

An execution environment typically used by hosting providers,
where applications have some permissions but not others. For
example, applications might be able to access a database server
over a network, but be “sandboxed” with regard to
reading and writing local files.


See Also [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_net).

Performance Schema

The `performance_schema` schema, in MySQL 5.5
and up, presents a set of tables that you can query to get
detailed information about the performance characteristics of
many internal parts of the MySQL server. See
[Chapter 29, _MySQL Performance Schema_](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema.html "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema").


See Also [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_information_schema), [latch](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_latch), [mutex](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mutex), [rw-lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rw_lock).

Perl

A programming language with roots in Unix scripting and report
generation. Incorporates high-performance regular expressions
and file I/O. Large collection of reusable modules available
through repositories such as CPAN.


See Also [Perl API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_perl_api).

Perl API

An open-source **API** for MySQL
applications written in the
**Perl** language. Implemented
through the `DBI` and
`DBD::mysql` modules. For details, see
[Section 31.9, “MySQL Perl API”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/apis-perl.html "31.9 MySQL Perl API").


See Also [API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_api), [Perl](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_perl).

persistent statistics

A feature that stores **index**
statistics for `InnoDB` **tables** on disk, providing
better **plan stability** for
**queries**. For more information,
see [Section 17.8.10.1, “Configuring Persistent Optimizer Statistics Parameters”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-persistent-stats.html "17.8.10.1 Configuring Persistent Optimizer Statistics Parameters").


See Also [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [optimizer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_optimizer), [plan stability](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_plan_stability), [query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table).

pessimistic

A methodology that sacrifices performance or concurrency in
favor of safety. It is appropriate if a high proportion of
requests or attempts might fail, or if the consequences of a
failed request are severe. `InnoDB` uses what
is known as a pessimistic
**locking** strategy, to minimize
the chance of **deadlocks**. At the
application level, you might avoid deadlocks by using a
pessimistic strategy of acquiring all locks needed by a
transaction at the very beginning.


Many built-in database mechanisms use the opposite
**optimistic** methodology.


See Also [deadlock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_deadlock), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [optimistic](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_optimistic).

phantom

A row that appears in the result set of a query, but not in the
result set of an earlier query. For example, if a query is run
twice within a **transaction**, and
in the meantime, another transaction commits after inserting a
new row or updating a row so that it matches the
`WHERE` clause of the query.


This occurrence is known as a phantom read. It is harder to
guard against than a **non-repeatable**
**read**, because locking all the rows from the first
query result set does not prevent the changes that cause the
phantom to appear.


Among different **isolation**
**levels**, phantom reads are prevented by the
**serializable read** level, and
allowed by the **repeatable read**,
**consistent read**, and
**read uncommitted** levels.


See Also [consistent read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [non-repeatable read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_non_repeatable_read), [READ UNCOMMITTED](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_uncommitted), [REPEATABLE READ](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_repeatable_read), [SERIALIZABLE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_serializable), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

PHP

A programming language originating with web applications. The
code is typically embedded as blocks within the source of a web
page, with the output substituted into the page as it is
transmitted by the web server. This is in contrast to
applications such as CGI scripts that print output in the form
of an entire web page. The PHP style of coding is used for
highly interactive and dynamic web pages. Modern PHP programs
can also be run as command-line or GUI applications.


MySQL applications are written using one of the
**PHP APIs**. Reusable modules can
be written in **C** and called from
PHP.


Another technology for writing server-side web pages with MySQL
is **ASP.net**.


See Also [ASP.net](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_asp_net), [C](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_c), [PHP API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_php_api).

PHP API

Several **APIs** are available for
writing MySQL applications in the
**PHP** language: the original
MySQL API ( `Mysql`) the MySQL Improved
Extension ( `Mysqli`) the MySQL Native Driver
( `Mysqlnd`) the MySQL functions
( `PDO_MYSQL`), and Connector/PHP. For details,
see [MySQL and PHP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/apis-php/en/).


See Also [API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_api), [PHP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_php).

physical

A type of operation that involves hardware-related aspects such
as disk blocks, memory pages, files, bits, disk reads, and so
on. Typically, physical aspects are important during
expert-level performance tuning and problem diagnosis. Contrast
with **logical**.


See Also [logical](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_logical), [physical backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_physical_backup).

physical backup

A **backup** that copies the actual
data files. For example, the
**`mysqlbackup`**
command of the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product
produces a physical backup, because its output contains data
files that can be used directly by the `mysqld`
server, resulting in a faster
**restore** operation. Contrast
with **logical backup**.


See Also [backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_backup), [logical backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_logical_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [restore](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_restore).

PITR

Acronym for **point-in-time**
**recovery**.


See Also [point-in-time recovery](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_point_in_time_recovery).

plan stability

A property of a **query execution**
**plan**, where the optimizer makes the same choices each
time for a given **query**, so that
performance is consistent and predictable.


See Also [query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query), [query execution plan](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query_execution_plan).

point-in-time recovery

The process of restoring a
**backup** to recreate the state of
the database at a specific date and time. Commonly abbreviated
“PITR”. Because it is unlikely that the specified
time corresponds exactly to the time of a backup, this technique
usually requires a combination of a
**physical backup** and a
**logical backup**. For example,
with the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, you
restore the last backup that you took before the specified point
in time, then replay changes from the
**binary log** between the time of
the backup and the PITR time.


See Also [backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_backup), [binary log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_binary_log), [logical backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_logical_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [physical backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_physical_backup).

port

The number of the TCP/IP socket the database server listens on,
used to establish a **connection**.
Often specified in conjunction with a
**host**. Depending on your use of
network encryption, there might be one port for unencrypted
traffic and another port for
**SSL** connections.


See Also [connection](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connection), [host](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_host), [SSL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ssl).

prefix

See [index prefix](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index_prefix).

prepared backup

A set of backup files, produced by the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, after all the
stages of applying **binary logs**
and **incremental backups** are
finished. The resulting files are ready to be
**restored**. Prior to the apply
steps, the files are known as a **raw**
**backup**.


See Also [binary log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_binary_log), [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup), [incremental backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_incremental_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [raw backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_raw_backup), [restore](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_restore).

prepared statement

An SQL statement that is analyzed in advance to determine an
efficient execution plan. It can be executed multiple times,
without the overhead for parsing and analysis each time.
Different values can be substituted for literals in the
`WHERE` clause each time, through the use of
placeholders. This substitution technique improves security,
protecting against some kinds of SQL injection attacks. You can
also reduce the overhead for converting and copying return
values to program variables.


Although you can use prepared statements directly through SQL
syntax, the various **Connectors**
have programming interfaces for manipulating prepared
statements, and these APIs are more efficient than going through
SQL.


See Also [client-side prepared statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_client_side_prepared_statement), [connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector), [server-side prepared statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_server_side_prepared_statement).

primary key

A set of columns—and by implication, the index based on
this set of columns—that can uniquely identify every row
in a table. As such, it must be a unique index that does not
contain any `NULL` values.


`InnoDB` requires that every table has such an
index (also called the **clustered**
**index** or **cluster**
**index**), and organizes the table storage based on the
column values of the primary key.


When choosing primary key values, consider using arbitrary
values (a **synthetic key**) rather
than relying on values derived from some other source (a
**natural key**).


See Also [clustered index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_clustered_index), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [natural key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_natural_key), [synthetic key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_synthetic_key).

principal

The Kerberos term for a named entity, such as a user or server.


See Also [service principal name](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_service_principal_name), [user principal name](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_user_principal_name).

process

An instance of an executing program. The operating system
switches between multiple running processes, allowing for a
certain degree of **concurrency**.
On most operating systems, processes can contain multiple
**threads** of execution that share
resources. Context-switching between threads is faster than the
equivalent switching between processes.


See Also [concurrency](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_concurrency), [thread](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_thread).

pseudo-record

An artificial record in an index, used for
**locking** key values or ranges
that do not currently exist.


See Also [infimum record](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_infimum_record), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [supremum record](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_supremum_record).

Pthreads

The POSIX threads standard, which defines an API for threading
and locking operations on Unix and Linux systems. On Unix and
Linux systems, `InnoDB` uses this
implementation for **mutexes**.


See Also [mutex](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mutex).

purge

A type of garbage collection performed by one or more separate
background threads (controlled by
[`innodb_purge_threads`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_purge_threads)) that runs
on a periodic schedule. Purge parses and processes
**undo log** pages from the
**history list** for the purpose of
removing clustered and secondary index records that were marked
for deletion (by previous [`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html "15.2.2 DELETE Statement")
statements) and are no longer required for
**MVCC** or
**rollback**. Purge frees undo log
pages from the history list after processing them.


See Also [history list](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_history_list), [MVCC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mvcc), [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback), [undo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log).

purge buffering

The technique of storing changes to secondary index pages,
resulting from `DELETE` operations, in the
**change buffer** rather than
writing the changes immediately, so that the physical writes can
be performed to minimize random I/O. (Because delete operations
are a two-step process, this operation buffers the write that
normally purges an index record that was previously marked for
deletion.) It is one of the types of
**change buffering**; the others
are **insert buffering** and
**delete buffering**.


See Also [change buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffer), [change buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffering), [delete buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_delete_buffering), [insert buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_insert_buffer), [insert buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_insert_buffering).

purge lag

Another name for the `InnoDB` **history list**. Related to the
[`innodb_max_purge_lag`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag)
configuration option.


See Also [history list](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_history_list), [purge](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_purge).

purge thread

A **thread** within the
`InnoDB` process that is dedicated to
performing the periodic **purge**
operation. In MySQL 5.6 and higher, multiple purge threads are
enabled by the
[`innodb_purge_threads`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_purge_threads)
configuration option.


See Also [purge](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_purge), [thread](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_thread).

Python

A programming language used in a broad range of fields, from
Unix scripting to large-scale applications. Includes runtime
typing, built-in high-level data types, object-oriented
features, and an extensive standard library. Often used as a
“glue” language between components written in other
languages. The MySQL **Python API**
is the open-source **MySQLdb**
module.


See Also [MySQLdb](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqldb), [Python API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_python_api).

Python API

See Also [API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_api), [Python](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_python).

### Q

query

In **SQL**, an operation that reads
information from one or more
**tables**. Depending on the
organization of data and the parameters of the query, the lookup
might be optimized by consulting an
**index**. If multiple tables are
involved, the query is known as a
**join**.


For historical reasons, sometimes discussions of internal
processing for statements use “query” in a broader
sense, including other types of MySQL statements such as
**DDL** and
**DML** statements.


See Also [DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ddl), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [join](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_join), [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sql), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table).

query execution plan

The set of decisions made by the optimizer about how to perform
a **query** most efficiently,
including which **index** or
indexes to use, and the order in which to
**join** tables.
**Plan stability** involves the
same choices being made consistently for a given query.


See Also [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [join](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_join), [plan stability](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_plan_stability), [query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query).

query log

See [general query log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_general_query_log).

quiesce

To reduce the amount of database activity, often in preparation
for an operation such as an [`ALTER\\
        TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"), a **backup**, or a
**shutdown**. Might or might not
involve doing as much **flushing**
as possible, so that **InnoDB**
does not continue doing background I/O.


In MySQL 5.6 and higher, the syntax `FLUSH TABLES ...
        FOR EXPORT` writes some data to disk for
`InnoDB` tables that make it simpler to back up
those tables by copying the data files.

See Also [backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_backup), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb), [shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_shutdown).

### R

R-tree

A tree data structure used for spatial indexing of
multi-dimensional data such as geographical coordinates,
rectangles or polygons.


See Also [B-tree](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_b_tree).

RAID

Acronym for “Redundant Array of Inexpensive
Drives”. Spreading I/O operations across multiple drives
enables greater **concurrency** at
the hardware level, and improves the efficiency of low-level
write operations that otherwise would be performed in sequence.


See Also [concurrency](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_concurrency).

random dive

A technique for quickly estimating the number of different
values in a column (the column's
**cardinality**).
`InnoDB` samples pages at random from the index
and uses that data to estimate the number of different values.


See Also [cardinality](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cardinality).

raw backup

The initial set of backup files produced by the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, before the
changes reflected in the **binary**
**log** and any **incremental**
**backups** are applied. At this stage, the files are not
ready to **restore**. After these
changes are applied, the files are known as a
**prepared backup**.


See Also [binary log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_binary_log), [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup), [ibbackup\_logfile](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ibbackup_logfile), [incremental backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_incremental_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [prepared backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_prepared_backup), [restore](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_restore).

READ COMMITTED

An **isolation level** that uses a
**locking** strategy that relaxes
some of the protection between
**transactions**, in the interest
of performance. Transactions cannot see uncommitted data from
other transactions, but they can see data that is committed by
another transaction after the current transaction started. Thus,
a transaction never sees any bad data, but the data that it does
see may depend to some extent on the timing of other
transactions.


When a transaction with this isolation level performs
`UPDATE ... WHERE` or `DELETE ...
        WHERE` operations, other transactions might have to
wait. The transaction can perform `SELECT ... FOR
        UPDATE`, and `LOCK IN SHARE MODE`
operations without making other transactions wait.


`SELECT ... FOR SHARE` replaces `SELECT
        ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` in MySQL 8.0.1, but
`LOCK IN SHARE MODE` remains available for
backward compatibility.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [REPEATABLE READ](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_repeatable_read), [SERIALIZABLE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_serializable), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

read phenomena

Phenomena such as **dirty reads**,
**non-repeatable reads**, and
**phantom** reads which can occur
when a transaction reads data that another transaction has
modified.


See Also [dirty read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dirty_read), [non-repeatable read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_non_repeatable_read), [phantom](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_phantom).

READ UNCOMMITTED

The **isolation level** that
provides the least amount of protection between transactions.
Queries employ a **locking**
strategy that allows them to proceed in situations where they
would normally wait for another transaction. However, this extra
performance comes at the cost of less reliable results,
including data that has been changed by other transactions and
not committed yet (known as **dirty**
**read**). Use this isolation level with great caution,
and be aware that the results might not be consistent or
reproducible, depending on what other transactions are doing at
the same time. Typically, transactions with this isolation level
only do queries, not insert, update, or delete operations.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [dirty read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dirty_read), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

read view

An internal snapshot used by the
**MVCC** mechanism of
`InnoDB`. Certain
**transactions**, depending on
their **isolation level**, see the
data values as they were at the time the transaction (or in some
cases, the statement) started. Isolation levels that use a read
view are **REPEATABLE READ**,
**READ COMMITTED**, and
**READ UNCOMMITTED**.


See Also [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [MVCC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mvcc), [READ COMMITTED](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_committed), [READ UNCOMMITTED](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_uncommitted), [REPEATABLE READ](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_repeatable_read), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

read-ahead

A type of I/O request that prefetches a group of
**pages** (an entire
**extent**) into the
**buffer pool** asynchronously, in
case these pages are needed soon. The linear read-ahead
technique prefetches all the pages of one extent based on access
patterns for pages in the preceding extent. The random
read-ahead technique prefetches all the pages for an extent once
a certain number of pages from the same extent are in the buffer
pool. Random read-ahead is not part of MySQL 5.5, but is
re-introduced in MySQL 5.6 under the control of the
[`innodb_random_read_ahead`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_random_read_ahead)
configuration option.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [extent](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_extent), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page).

read-only transaction

A type of **transaction** that can
be optimized for `InnoDB` tables by eliminating
some of the bookkeeping involved with creating a
**read view** for each transaction.
Can only perform **non-locking**
**read** queries. It can be started explicitly with the
syntax [`START TRANSACTION\\
        READ ONLY`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"), or automatically under certain conditions.
See [Section 10.5.3, “Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-performance-ro-txn.html "10.5.3 Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions") for details.


See Also [non-locking read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_non_locking_read), [read view](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_view), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

record lock

A [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock "lock") on an index record. For
example, `SELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c1 = 10 FOR
        UPDATE;` prevents any other transaction from inserting,
updating, or deleting rows where the value of
`t.c1` is 10. Contrast with
**gap lock** and
**next-key lock**.


See Also [gap lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_gap_lock), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [next-key lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_next_key_lock).

redo

The data, in units of records, recorded in the
**redo log** when
[DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml "DML") statements make changes to
`InnoDB` tables. It is used during
**crash recovery** to correct data
written by incomplete
**transactions**. The
ever-increasing **LSN** value
represents the cumulative amount of redo data that has passed
through the redo log.


See Also [crash recovery](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_crash_recovery), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [LSN](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lsn), [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

redo log

A disk-based data structure used during
**crash recovery**, to correct data
written by incomplete
**transactions**. During normal
operation, it encodes requests to change
`InnoDB` table data, which result from SQL
statements or low-level API calls. Modifications that did not
finish updating the **data files**
before an unexpected **shutdown**
are replayed automatically.


The redo log is physically represented on disk as a set of redo
log files. Redo log data is encoded in terms of records
affected; this data is collectively referred to as
**redo**. The passage of data
through the redo log is represented by an ever-increasing
**LSN** value.


For more information, see [Section 17.6.5, “Redo Log”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-redo-log.html "17.6.5 Redo Log")

See Also [crash recovery](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_crash_recovery), [data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files), [ib\_logfile](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ib_logfile), [log buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_log_buffer), [LSN](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lsn), [redo](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo), [shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_shutdown), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

redo log archiving

An `InnoDB` feature that, when enabled,
sequentially writes redo log records to an archive file to avoid
potential loss of data than can occur when a backup utility
fails to keep pace with redo log generation while a backup
operation is in progress. For more information, see
[Redo Log Archiving](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-redo-log.html#innodb-redo-log-archiving "Redo Log Archiving").


See Also [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log).

redundant row format

The oldest `InnoDB` **row**
**format**. Prior to MySQL 5.0.3, it was the only row
format available in `InnoDB`. From MySQL 5.0.3
to MySQL 5.7.8, the default row format is
**COMPACT**. As of MySQL 5.7.9, the
default row format is defined by the
[`innodb_default_row_format`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
configuration option, which has a default setting of
**DYNAMIC**. You can still specify
the **REDUNDANT** row format for
compatibility with older `InnoDB` tables.


For more information, see [Section 17.10, “InnoDB Row Formats”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-row-format.html "17.10 InnoDB Row Formats").


See Also [compact row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compact_row_format), [dynamic row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dynamic_row_format), [row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_format).

referential integrity

The technique of maintaining data always in a consistent format,
part of the **ACID** philosophy. In
particular, data in different tables is kept consistent through
the use of **foreign key**
**constraints**, which can prevent changes from happening
or automatically propagate those changes to all related tables.
Related mechanisms include the **unique**
**constraint**, which prevents duplicate values from
being inserted by mistake, and the **NOT**
**NULL constraint**, which prevents blank values from
being inserted by mistake.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [FOREIGN KEY constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_foreign_key_constraint), [NOT NULL constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_not_null_constraint), [unique constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_unique_constraint).

relational

An important aspect of modern database systems. The database
server encodes and enforces relationships such as one-to-one,
one-to-many, many-to-one, and uniqueness. For example, a person
might have zero, one, or many phone numbers in an address
database; a single phone number might be associated with several
family members. In a financial database, a person might be
required to have exactly one taxpayer ID, and any taxpayer ID
could only be associated with one person.


The database server can use these relationships to prevent bad
data from being inserted, and to find efficient ways to look up
information. For example, if a value is declared to be unique,
the server can stop searching as soon as the first match is
found, and it can reject attempts to insert a second copy of the
same value.


At the database level, these relationships are expressed through
SQL features such as **columns**
within a table, unique and `NOT NULL` **constraints**,
**foreign keys**, and different
kinds of join operations. Complex relationships typically
involve data split between more than one table. Often, the data
is **normalized**, so that
duplicate values in one-to-many relationships are stored only
once.


In a mathematical context, the relations within a database are
derived from set theory. For example, the `OR`
and `AND` operators of a
`WHERE` clause represent the notions of union
and intersection.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_column), [constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_constraint), [foreign key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_foreign_key), [normalized](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_normalized).

relevance

In the **full-text search**
feature, a number signifying the similarity between the search
string and the data in the **FULLTEXT**
**index**. For example, when you search for a single
word, that word is typically more relevant for a row where it
occurs several times in the text than a row where it appears
only once.


See Also [full-text search](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_full_text_search), [FULLTEXT index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fulltext_index).

REPEATABLE READ

The default **isolation level** for
`InnoDB`. It prevents any rows that are queried
from being changed by other
**transactions**, thus blocking
**non-repeatable reads** but not
**phantom** reads. It uses a
moderately strict **locking**
strategy so that all queries within a transaction see data from
the same snapshot, that is, the data as it was at the time the
transaction started.


When a transaction with this isolation level performs
`UPDATE ... WHERE`, `DELETE ...
        WHERE`, `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, and
`LOCK IN SHARE MODE` operations, other
transactions might have to wait.


`SELECT ... FOR SHARE` replaces `SELECT
        ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` in MySQL 8.0.1, but
`LOCK IN SHARE MODE` remains available for
backward compatibility.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [consistent read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [phantom](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_phantom), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

repertoire

Repertoire is a term applied to character sets. A character set
repertoire is the collection of characters in the set. See
[Section 12.2.1, “Character Set Repertoire”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-repertoire.html "12.2.1 Character Set Repertoire").


replica

A database **server** machine in a
**replication** topology that
receives changes from another server (the
**source**) and applies those same
changes. Thus it maintains the same contents as the source,
although it might lag somewhat behind.


In MySQL, replicas are commonly used in disaster recovery, to
take the place of a source that fails. They are also commonly
used for testing software upgrades and new settings, to ensure
that database configuration changes do not cause problems with
performance or reliability.


Replicas typically have high workloads, because they process all
the **DML** (write) operations
relayed from the source, as well as user queries. To ensure that
replicas can apply changes from the source fast enough, they
frequently have fast I/O devices and sufficient CPU and memory
to run multiple database instances on the same server. For
example, the source might use hard drive storage while the
replicas use **SSD**s.


See Also [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replication), [server](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_server), [source](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_source), [SSD](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ssd).

replication

The practice of sending changes from a
**source**, to one or more
**replicas**, so that all databases
have the same data. This technique has a wide range of uses,
such as load-balancing for better scalability, disaster
recovery, and testing software upgrades and configuration
changes. The changes can be sent between the databases by
methods called **row-based**
**replication** and **statement-based**
**replication**.


See Also [replica](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replica), [row-based replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_based_replication), [source](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_source), [statement-based replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_statement_based_replication).

restore

The process of putting a set of backup files from the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product in place for use
by MySQL. This operation can be performed to fix a corrupted
database, to return to some earlier point in time, or (in a
**replication** context) to set up
a new **replica**. In the
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, this operation
is performed by the `copy-back` option of the
`mysqlbackup` command.


See Also [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqlbackup_command), [prepared backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_prepared_backup), [replica](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replica), [replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replication).

rollback

A **SQL** statement that ends a
**transaction**, undoing any
changes made by the transaction. It is the opposite of
**commit**, which makes permanent
any changes made in the transaction.


By default, MySQL uses the
**autocommit** setting, which
automatically issues a commit following each SQL statement. You
must change this setting before you can use the rollback
technique.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [autocommit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_autocommit), [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sql), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

rollback segment

The storage area containing the **undo**
**logs**. Rollback segments have traditionally resided in
the **system tablespace**. As of
MySQL 5.6, rollback segments can reside in
**undo tablespaces**. As of MySQL
5.7, rollback segments are also allocated to the
_global temporary tablespace_.


See Also [global temporary tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_global_temporary_tablespace), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace), [undo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log), [undo tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_tablespace).

row

The logical data structure defined by a set of
**columns**. A set of rows makes up
a **table**. Within
`InnoDB` **data**
**files**, each **page** can
contain one or more rows.


Although `InnoDB` uses the term
**row format** for consistency with
MySQL syntax, the row format is a property of each table and
applies to all rows in that table.


See Also [column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_column), [data files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_data_files), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page), [row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_format), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table).

row format

The disk storage format for
**rows** of an
`InnoDB` **table**. As
`InnoDB` gains new capabilities such as
**compression**, new row formats
are introduced to support the resulting improvements in storage
efficiency and performance.


The row format of an `InnoDB` table is
specified by the `ROW_FORMAT` option or by the
[`innodb_default_row_format`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
configuration option (introduced in MySQL 5.7.9). Row formats
include `REDUNDANT`,
`COMPACT`, `COMPRESSED`, and
`DYNAMIC`. To view the row format of an
`InnoDB` table, issue the
[`SHOW TABLE STATUS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-table-status.html "15.7.7.38 SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement") statement or
query `InnoDB` table metadata in the
[`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema.html "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables").


See Also [compact row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compact_row_format), [compressed row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compressed_row_format), [compression](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_compression), [dynamic row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dynamic_row_format), [redundant row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redundant_row_format), [row](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table).

row lock

A **lock** that prevents a row from
being accessed in an incompatible way by another
**transaction**. Other rows in the
same table can be freely written to by other transactions. This
is the type of **locking** done by
**DML** operations on
**InnoDB** tables.


Contrast with **table locks** used
by [`MyISAM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/myisam-storage-engine.html "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine"), or during
**DDL** operations on
`InnoDB` tables that cannot be done with
**online DDL**; those locks block
concurrent access to the table.


See Also [DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ddl), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [online DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_online_ddl), [table lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table_lock), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

row-based replication

A form of **replication** where
events are propagated from the
**source** specifying how to change
individual rows on the **replica**.
It is safe to use for all settings of the
[`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
option.

row-level locking

The **locking** mechanism used for
**InnoDB** tables, relying on
**row locks** rather than
**table locks**. Multiple
**transactions** can modify the
same table concurrently. Only if two transactions try to modify
the same row does one of the transactions wait for the other to
complete (and release its row locks).


See Also [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [row lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_lock), [table lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table_lock), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

Ruby

A programming language that emphasizes dynamic typing and
object-oriented programming. Some syntax is familiar to
**Perl** developers.


See Also [API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_api), [Perl](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_perl), [Ruby API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ruby_api).

Ruby API

`mysql2`, based based on the
**libmysqlclient** API library, is
available for Ruby programmers developing MySQL applications.
For more information, see [Section 31.11, “MySQL Ruby APIs”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/apis-ruby.html "31.11 MySQL Ruby APIs").


See Also [libmysql](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_libmysql), [Ruby](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ruby).

rw-lock

The low-level object that `InnoDB` uses to
represent and enforce shared-access
**locks** to internal in-memory
data structures following certain rules. Contrast with
**mutexes**, which
`InnoDB` uses to represent and enforce
exclusive access to internal in-memory data structures. Mutexes
and rw-locks are known collectively as
**latches**.


`rw-lock` types include
`s-locks` (shared locks),
`x-locks` (exclusive locks), and
`sx-locks` (shared-exclusive locks).

- An `s-lock` provides read access to a
common resource.


- An `x-lock` provides write access to a
common resource while not permitting inconsistent reads by
other threads.


- An `sx-lock` provides write access to a
common resource while permitting inconsistent reads by other
threads. `sx-locks` were introduced in
MySQL 5.7 to optimize concurrency and improve scalability
for read-write workloads.


The following matrix summarizes rw-lock type compatibility.

|  | _`S`_ | _`SX`_ | _`X`_ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _`S`_ | Compatible | Compatible | Conflict |
| _`SX`_ | Compatible | Conflict | Conflict |
| _`X`_ | Conflict | Conflict | Conflict |

### S

savepoint

Savepoints help to implement nested
**transactions**. They can be used
to provide scope to operations on tables that are part of a
larger transaction. For example, scheduling a trip in a
reservation system might involve booking several different
flights; if a desired flight is unavailable, you might
**roll back** the changes involved
in booking that one leg, without rolling back the earlier
flights that were successfully booked.


See Also [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

scalability

The ability to add more work and issue more simultaneous
requests to a system, without a sudden drop in performance due
to exceeding the limits of system capacity. Software
architecture, hardware configuration, application coding, and
type of workload all play a part in scalability. When the system
reaches its maximum capacity, popular techniques for increasing
scalability are **scale up**
(increasing the capacity of existing hardware or software) and
**scale out** (adding new servers
and more instances of MySQL). Often paired with
**availability** as critical
aspects of a large-scale deployment.


See Also [availability](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_availability), [scale out](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_scale_out), [scale up](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_scale_up).

scale out

A technique for increasing
**scalability** by adding new
servers and more instances of MySQL. For example, setting up
replication, NDB Cluster, connection pooling, or other features
that spread work across a group of servers. Contrast with
**scale up**.


See Also [scalability](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_scalability), [scale up](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_scale_up).

scale up

A technique for increasing
**scalability** by increasing the
capacity of existing hardware or software. For example,
increasing the memory on a server and adjusting memory-related
parameters such as
[`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size) and
[`innodb_buffer_pool_instances`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_instances).
Contrast with **scale out**.


See Also [scalability](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_scalability), [scale out](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_scale_out).

schema

Conceptually, a schema is a set of interrelated database
objects, such as tables, table columns, data types of the
columns, indexes, foreign keys, and so on. These objects are
connected through SQL syntax, because the columns make up the
tables, the foreign keys refer to tables and columns, and so on.
Ideally, they are also connected logically, working together as
part of a unified application or flexible framework. For
example, the **INFORMATION\_SCHEMA**
and **performance\_schema**
databases use “schema” in their names to emphasize
the close relationships between the tables and columns they
contain.


In MySQL, physically, a **schema**
is synonymous with a **database**.
You can substitute the keyword `SCHEMA` instead
of `DATABASE` in MySQL SQL syntax, for example
using `CREATE SCHEMA` instead of
`CREATE DATABASE`.


Some other database products draw a distinction. For example, in
the Oracle Database product, a
**schema** represents only a part
of a database: the tables and other objects owned by a single
user.


See Also [database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_database), [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_information_schema), [Performance Schema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_performance_schema).

SDI

Acronym for “serialized dictionary information”.


See Also [serialized dictionary information (SDI)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_serialized_dictionary_information).

search index

In MySQL, **full-text search**
queries use a special kind of index, the
**FULLTEXT index**. In MySQL 5.6.4
and up, `InnoDB` and `MyISAM`
tables both support `FULLTEXT` indexes;
formerly, these indexes were only available for
`MyISAM` tables.


See Also [full-text search](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_full_text_search), [FULLTEXT index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fulltext_index).

secondary index

A type of `InnoDB` **index** that represents a subset
of table columns. An `InnoDB` table can have
zero, one, or many secondary indexes. (Contrast with the
**clustered index**, which is
required for each `InnoDB` table, and stores
the data for all the table columns.)


A secondary index can be used to satisfy queries that only
require values from the indexed columns. For more complex
queries, it can be used to identify the relevant rows in the
table, which are then retrieved through lookups using the
clustered index.


Creating and dropping secondary indexes has traditionally
involved significant overhead from copying all the data in the
`InnoDB` table. The **fast**
**index creation** feature makes both `CREATE
        INDEX` and `DROP INDEX` statements
much faster for `InnoDB` secondary indexes.


See Also [clustered index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_clustered_index), [Fast Index Creation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fast_index_creation), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index).

segment

A division within an `InnoDB` **tablespace**. If a tablespace is
analogous to a directory, the segments are analogous to files
within that directory. A segment can grow. New segments can be
created.


For example, within a
**file-per-table** tablespace,
table data is in one segment and each associated index is in its
own segment. The **system**
**tablespace** contains many different segments, because
it can hold many tables and their associated indexes. Prior to
MySQL 8.0, the system tablespace also includes one or more
**rollback segments** used for
**undo logs**.


Segments grow and shrink as data is inserted and deleted. When a
segment needs more room, it is extended by one
**extent** (1 megabyte) at a time.
Similarly, a segment releases one extent's worth of space when
all the data in that extent is no longer needed.


See Also [extent](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_extent), [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [rollback segment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback_segment), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace), [tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_tablespace), [undo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log).

selectivity

A property of data distribution, the number of distinct values
in a column (its **cardinality**)
divided by the number of records in the table. High selectivity
means that the column values are relatively unique, and can
retrieved efficiently through an index. If you (or the query
optimizer) can predict that a test in a `WHERE`
clause only matches a small number (or proportion) of rows in a
table, the overall **query** tends
to be efficient if it evaluates that test first, using an index.


See Also [cardinality](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cardinality), [query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query).

semi-consistent read

A type of read operation used for `UPDATE`
statements, that is a combination of **READ**
**COMMITTED** and **consistent**
**read**. When an `UPDATE` statement
examines a row that is already locked, `InnoDB`
returns the latest committed version to MySQL so that MySQL can
determine whether the row matches the `WHERE`
condition of the `UPDATE`. If the row matches
(must be updated), MySQL reads the row again, and this time
`InnoDB` either locks it or waits for a lock on
it. This type of read operation can only happen when the
transaction has the READ COMMITTED
**isolation level**.


See Also [consistent read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [READ COMMITTED](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_read_committed).

SERIALIZABLE

The **isolation level** that uses
the most conservative locking strategy, to prevent any other
**transactions** from inserting or
changing data that was read by this transaction, until it is
finished. This way, the same query can be run over and over
within a transaction, and be certain to retrieve the same set of
results each time. Any attempt to change data that was committed
by another transaction since the start of the current
transaction, cause the current transaction to wait.


This is the default isolation level specified by the SQL
standard. In practice, this degree of strictness is rarely
needed, so the default isolation level for
`InnoDB` is the next most strict,
**REPEATABLE READ**.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [consistent read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [REPEATABLE READ](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_repeatable_read), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

serialized dictionary information (SDI)

Dictionary object metadata in serialized form. SDI is stored in
`JSON` format.


As of MySQL 8.0.3, SDI is present in all
`InnoDB` tablespace files except for temporary
tablespace and undo tablespace files. The presence of SDI in
tablespace files provides metadata redundancy. For example,
dictionary object metadata can be extracted from tablespace
files using the [**ibd2sdi**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/ibd2sdi.html "6.6.1 ibd2sdi — InnoDB Tablespace SDI Extraction Utility") utility if the data
dictionary becomes unavailable.


For a `MyISAM` table, SDI is stored in a
`.sdi` metadata file in the schema directory.
An SDI metadata file is required to perform an
[`IMPORT TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/import-table.html "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement") operation.


See Also [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [general tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_general_tablespace), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace), [tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_tablespace).

server

A type of program that runs continuously, waiting to receive and
act upon requests from another program (the
**client**). Because often an
entire computer is dedicated to running one or more server
programs (such as a database server, a web server, an
application server, or some combination of these), the term
**server** can also refer to the
computer that runs the server software.


See Also [client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_client), [mysqld](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysqld).

server-side prepared statement

A **prepared statement** managed by
the MySQL server. Historically, issues with server-side prepared
statements led **Connector/J** and
**Connector/PHP** developers to
sometimes use **client-side prepared**
**statements** instead. With modern MySQL server
versions, server-side prepared statements are recommended for
performance, scalability, and memory efficiency.


See Also [client-side prepared statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_client_side_prepared_statement), [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [Connector/PHP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_php), [prepared statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_prepared_statement).

service principal name

The name for a Kerberos named entity that represents a service.


See Also [principal](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_principal).

service ticket

A Kerberos ticket that provides access to an application
service, such as the service provided by a web or database
server.


servlet

See Also [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j).

session temporary tablespace

A _temporary tablespace_ that stores
user-created _temporary tables_ and internal
temporary tables created by the _optimizer_
when `InnoDB` is configured as the on-disk
storage engine for internal temporary tables.


See Also [optimizer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_optimizer), [temporary table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_temporary_table), [temporary tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_temporary_tablespace).

shared lock

A kind of **lock** that allows
other **transactions** to read the
locked object, and to also acquire other shared locks on it, but
not to write to it. The opposite of
**exclusive lock**.


See Also [exclusive lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_exclusive_lock), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

shared tablespace

Another way of referring to the **system**
**tablespace** or a **general**
**tablespace**. General tablespaces were introduced in
MySQL 5.7. More than one table can reside in a shared
tablespace. Only a single table can reside in a
_file-per-table_ tablespace.


See Also [general tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_general_tablespace), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace).

sharp checkpoint

The process of **flushing** to disk
all **dirty** buffer pool pages
whose redo entries are contained in certain portion of the
**redo log**. Occurs before
`InnoDB` reuses a portion of a log file; the
log files are used in a circular fashion. Typically occurs with
write-intensive **workloads**.


See Also [dirty page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dirty_page), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [redo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_redo_log), [workload](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_workload).

shutdown

The process of stopping the MySQL server. By default, this
process cleans up operations for
**InnoDB** tables, so
`InnoDB` can be
**slow** to shut down, but fast to
start up later. If you skip the cleanup operations, it is
**fast** to shut down but the
cleanup must be performed during the next restart.


The shutdown mode for `InnoDB` is controlled by
the [`innodb_fast_shutdown`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_fast_shutdown)
option.


See Also [fast shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fast_shutdown), [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb), [slow shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_slow_shutdown), [startup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_startup).

slave

See [replica](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replica).

slow query log

A type of **log** used for
performance tuning of SQL statements processed by the MySQL
server. The log information is stored in a file. You must enable
this feature to use it. You control which categories of
“slow” SQL statements are logged. For more
information, see [Section 7.4.5, “The Slow Query Log”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/slow-query-log.html "7.4.5 The Slow Query Log").



See Also [general query log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_general_query_log), [log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_log).

slow shutdown

A type of **shutdown** that does
additional `InnoDB` flushing operations before
completing. Also known as a **clean**
**shutdown**. Specified by the configuration parameter
[`innodb_fast_shutdown=0`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_fast_shutdown) or the
command `SET GLOBAL innodb_fast_shutdown=0;`.
Although the shutdown itself can take longer, that time should
be saved on the subsequent startup.


See Also [clean shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_clean_shutdown), [fast shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fast_shutdown), [shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_shutdown).

snapshot

A representation of data at a particular time, which remains the
same even as changes are
**committed** by other
**transactions**. Used by certain
**isolation levels** to allow
**consistent reads**.


See Also [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [consistent read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

sort buffer

The buffer used for sorting data during creation of an
`InnoDB` index. Sort buffer size is configured
using the
[`innodb_sort_buffer_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_sort_buffer_size)
configuration option.


source

A database server machine in a
**replication** scenario that
processes the initial insert, update, and delete requests for
data. These changes are propagated to, and repeated on, other
servers known as **replicas**.


See Also [replica](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replica), [replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replication).

space ID

An identifier used to uniquely identify an
`InnoDB` **tablespace** within a MySQL
instance. The space ID for the **system**
**tablespace** is always zero; this same ID applies to
all tables within the system tablespace or within a general
tablespace. Each **file-per-table**
tablespace and **general**
**tablespace** has its own space ID.


Prior to MySQL 5.6, this hardcoded value presented difficulties
in moving `InnoDB` tablespace files between
MySQL instances. Starting in MySQL 5.6, you can copy tablespace
files between instances by using the
**transportable tablespace**
feature involving the statements `FLUSH TABLES ... FOR
        EXPORT`, `ALTER TABLE ... DISCARD
        TABLESPACE`, and `ALTER TABLE ... IMPORT
        TABLESPACE`. The information needed to adjust the space
ID is conveyed in the **.cfg file**
which you copy along with the tablespace. See
[Section 17.6.1.3, “Importing InnoDB Tables”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-table-import.html "17.6.1.3 Importing InnoDB Tables") for details.

sparse file

A type of file that uses file system space more efficiently by
writing metadata representing empty blocks to disk instead of
writing the actual empty space. The `InnoDB` **transparent page compression**
feature relies on sparse file support. For more information, see
[Section 17.9.2, “InnoDB Page Compression”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-page-compression.html "17.9.2 InnoDB Page Compression").

spin

A type of **wait** operation that
continuously tests whether a resource becomes available. This
technique is used for resources that are typically held only for
brief periods, where it is more efficient to wait in a
“busy loop” than to put the thread to sleep and
perform a context switch. If the resource does not become
available within a short time, the spin loop ceases and another
wait technique is used.


See Also [latch](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_latch), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [mutex](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mutex), [wait](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_wait).

Spring

A Java-based application framework designed for assisting in
application design by providing a way to configure components.


See Also [J2EE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_j2ee).

SQL

The Structured Query Language that is standard for performing
database operations. Often divided into the categories
**DDL**,
**DML**, and
**queries**. MySQL includes some
additional statement categories such as
**replication**. See
[Chapter 11, _Language Structure_](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/language-structure.html "Chapter 11 Language Structure") for the building blocks of
SQL syntax, [Chapter 13, _Data Types_](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-types.html "Chapter 13 Data Types") for the data types to
use for MySQL table columns, [Chapter 15, _SQL Statements_](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-statements.html "Chapter 15 SQL Statements")
for details about SQL statements and their associated
categories, and [Chapter 14, _Functions and Operators_](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/functions.html "Chapter 14 Functions and Operators") for standard and
MySQL-specific functions to use in queries.

SQLState

An error code defined by the
**JDBC** standard, for exception
handling by applications using
**Connector/J**.


See Also [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [JDBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_jdbc).

SSD

Acronym for “solid-state drive”. A type of storage
device with different performance characteristics than a
traditional hard disk drive
(**HDD**): smaller storage
capacity, faster for random reads, no moving parts, and with a
number of considerations affecting write performance. Its
performance characteristics can influence the throughput of a
**disk-bound** workload.


See Also [disk-bound](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_disk_bound), [HDD](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hdd).

SSL

Acronym for “secure sockets layer”. Provides the
encryption layer for network communication between an
application and a MySQL database server.


See Also [keystore](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_keystore), [truststore](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_truststore).

ST

See [service ticket](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_service_ticket).

startup

The process of starting the MySQL server. Typically done by one
of the programs listed in [Section 6.3, “Server and Server-Startup Programs”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/programs-server.html "6.3 Server and Server-Startup Programs"). The
opposite of **shutdown**.


See Also [shutdown](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_shutdown).

statement interceptor

A type of **interceptor** for
tracing, debugging, or augmenting SQL statements issued by a
database application. Sometimes also known as a
**command interceptor**.


In **Java** applications using
**Connector/J**, setting up this
type of interceptor involves implementing the
`com.mysql.jdbc.StatementInterceptorV2`
interface, and adding a `statementInterceptors`
property to the **connection**
**string**.


In **Visual Studio** applications
using **Connector/NET**, setting up this
type of interceptor involves defining a class that inherits from
the `BaseCommandInterceptor` class and
specifying that class name as part of the connection string.


See Also [command interceptor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_command_interceptor), [connection string](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connection_string), [Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_j), [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_net), [interceptor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_interceptor), [Java](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_java), [Visual Studio](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_visual_studio).

statement-based replication

A form of **replication** where SQL
statements are sent from the
**source** and replayed on the
**replica**. It requires some care
with the setting for the
[`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
option, to avoid potential timing problems with
**auto-increment locking**.


See Also [auto-increment locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_auto_increment_locking), [innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode), [replica](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replica), [replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_replication), [row-based replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_based_replication), [source](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_source).

statistics

Estimated values relating to each `InnoDB` **table** and
**index**, used to construct an
efficient **query execution plan**.
The main values are the
**cardinality** (number of distinct
values) and the total number of table rows or index entries. The
statistics for the table represent the data in its
**primary key** index. The
statistics for a **secondary**
**index** represent the rows covered by that index.


The values are estimated rather than counted precisely because
at any moment, different
**transactions** can be inserting
and deleting rows from the same table. To keep the values from
being recalculated frequently, you can enable
**persistent statistics**, where
the values are stored in `InnoDB` system
tables, and refreshed only when you issue an
[`ANALYZE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/analyze-table.html "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement") statement.


You can control how **NULL** values
are treated when calculating statistics through the
[`innodb_stats_method`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_stats_method)
configuration option.


Other types of statistics are available for database objects and
database activity through the
**INFORMATION\_SCHEMA** and
**PERFORMANCE\_SCHEMA** tables.


See Also [cardinality](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cardinality), [index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_index), [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_information_schema), [NULL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_null), [Performance Schema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_performance_schema), [persistent statistics](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_persistent_statistics), [primary key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_primary_key), [query execution plan](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query_execution_plan), [secondary index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_secondary_index), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

stemming

The ability to search for different variations of a word based
on a common root word, such as singular and plural, or past,
present, and future verb tense. This feature is currently
supported in `MyISAM` **full-text search** feature but
not in **FULLTEXT indexes** for
`InnoDB` tables.


See Also [full-text search](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_full_text_search), [FULLTEXT index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fulltext_index).

stopword

In a **FULLTEXT index**, a word
that is considered common or trivial enough that it is omitted
from the **search index** and
ignored in search queries. Different configuration settings
control stopword processing for `InnoDB` and
`MyISAM` tables. See
[Section 14.9.4, “Full-Text Stopwords”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-stopwords.html "14.9.4 Full-Text Stopwords") for details.


See Also [FULLTEXT index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fulltext_index), [search index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_search_index).

storage engine

A component of the MySQL database that performs the low-level
work of storing, updating, and querying data. In MySQL 5.5 and
higher, **InnoDB** is the default
storage engine for new tables, superceding
`MyISAM`. Different storage engines are
designed with different tradeoffs between factors such as memory
usage versus disk usage, read speed versus write speed, and
speed versus robustness. Each storage engine manages specific
tables, so we refer to [`InnoDB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
tables, [`MyISAM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/myisam-storage-engine.html "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables, and so on.


The **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product is optimized
for backing up `InnoDB` tables. It can also
back up tables handled by `MyISAM` and other
storage engines.


See Also [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [table type](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table_type).

stored generated column

A column whose values are computed from an expression included
in the column definition. Column values are evaluated and stored
when rows are inserted or updated. A stored generated column
requires storage space and can be indexed.


Contrast with **virtual generated**
**column**.


See Also [base column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_base_column), [generated column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_generated_column), [virtual generated column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_virtual_generated_column).

stored object

A stored program or view.


stored program

A stored routine (procedure or function), trigger, or Event
Scheduler event.


stored routine

A stored procedure or function.


strict mode

The general name for the setting controlled by the
[`innodb_strict_mode`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) option.
Turning on this setting causes certain conditions that are
normally treated as warnings, to be considered errors. For
example, certain invalid combinations of options related to
**file format** and
**row format**, that normally
produce a warning and continue with default values, now cause
the `CREATE TABLE` operation to fail.
[`innodb_strict_mode`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) is enabled
by default in MySQL 5.7.


MySQL also has something called strict mode. See
[Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").


See Also [file format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_format), [innodb\_strict\_mode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb_strict_mode), [row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_format).

sublist

Within the list structure that represents the
**buffer pool**, pages that are
relatively old and relatively new are represented by different
portions of the **list**. A set of
parameters control the size of these portions and the dividing
point between the new and old pages.


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [eviction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_eviction), [list](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_list), [LRU](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lru).

supremum record

A **pseudo-record** in an index,
representing the **gap** above the
largest value in that index. If a transaction has a statement
such as `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE col > 10 FOR
        UPDATE;`, and the largest value in the column is 20, it
is a lock on the supremum record that prevents other
transactions from inserting even larger values such as 50, 100,
and so on.


See Also [gap](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_gap), [infimum record](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_infimum_record), [pseudo-record](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_pseudo_record).

surrogate key

Synonym name for **synthetic key**.


See Also [synthetic key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_synthetic_key).

synthetic key

An indexed column, typically a **primary**
**key**, where the values are assigned arbitrarily. Often
done using an **auto-increment**
column. By treating the value as completely arbitrary, you can
avoid overly restrictive rules and faulty application
assumptions. For example, a numeric sequence representing
employee numbers might have a gap if an employee was approved
for hiring but never actually joined. Or employee number 100
might have a later hiring date than employee number 500, if they
left the company and later rejoined. Numeric values also produce
shorter values of predictable length. For example, storing
numeric codes meaning “Road”,
“Boulevard”, “Expressway”, and so on
is more space-efficient than repeating those strings over and
over.


Also known as a **surrogate key**.
Contrast with **natural key**.


See Also [auto-increment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_auto_increment), [natural key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_natural_key), [primary key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_primary_key), [surrogate key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_surrogate_key).

system tablespace

One or more data files (**ibdata**
**files**) containing the metadata for
`InnoDB`-related objects, and the storage areas
for the **change buffer**, and the
**doublewrite buffer**. It may also
contain table and index data for `InnoDB`
tables if tables were created in the system tablespace instead
of **file-per-table** or
**general tablespaces**. The data
and metadata in the system tablespace apply to all
**databases** in a MySQL
**instance**.


Prior to MySQL 5.6.7, the default was to keep all
`InnoDB` tables and indexes inside the system
tablespace, often causing this file to become very large.
Because the system tablespace never shrinks, storage problems
could arise if large amounts of temporary data were loaded and
then deleted. In MySQL 8.0, the default is
**file-per-table** mode, where each
table and its associated indexes are stored in a separate
**.ibd file**. This default makes
it easier to use `InnoDB` features that rely on
`DYNAMIC` and `COMPRESSED` row
formats, such as table
**compression**, efficient storage
of **off-page columns**, and large
index key prefixes.


Keeping all table data in the system tablespace or in separate
`.ibd` files has implications for storage
management in general. The
**MySQL Enterprise Backup** product might back up a
small set of large files, or many smaller files. On systems with
thousands of tables, the file system operations to process
thousands of `.ibd` files can cause
bottlenecks.


`InnoDB` introduced general tablespaces in
MySQL 5.7.6, which are also represented by
`.ibd` files. General tablespaces are shared
tablespaces created using [`CREATE\\
        TABLESPACE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-tablespace.html "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax. They can be created outside of the
data directory, are capable of holding multiple tables, and
support tables of all row formats.

### T

table

Each MySQL table is associated with a particular
**storage engine**.
**InnoDB** tables have particular
**physical** and
**logical** characteristics that
affect performance,
**scalability**,
**backup**, administration, and
application development.


In terms of file storage, an `InnoDB` table
belongs to one of the following tablespace types:

- The shared `InnoDB` **system tablespace**, which is
comprised of one or more **ibdata**
**files**.


- A **file-per-table**
tablespace, comprised of an individual
**.ibd file**.


- A shared **general**
**tablespace**, comprised of an individual
`.ibd` file. General tablespaces were
introduced in MySQL 5.7.6.


**`.ibd`** data
files contain both table and
**index** data.


`InnoDB` tables created in file-per-table
tablespaces can use **DYNAMIC** or
**COMPRESSED** row format. These
row formats enable `InnoDB` features such as
**compression**, efficient storage
of **off-page columns**, and large
index key prefixes. General tablespaces support all row formats.


The system tablespace supports tables that use
**REDUNDANT**,
**COMPACT**, and
**DYNAMIC** row formats. System
tablespace support for the
**DYNAMIC** row format was added in
MySQL 5.7.6.


The **rows** of an
`InnoDB` table are organized into an index
structure known as the **clustered**
**index**, with entries sorted based on the
**primary key** columns of the
table. Data access is optimized for queries that filter and sort
on the primary key columns, and each index contains a copy of
the associated primary key columns for each entry. Modifying
values for any of the primary key columns is an expensive
operation. Thus an important aspect of `InnoDB`
table design is choosing a primary key with columns that are
used in the most important queries, and keeping the primary key
short, with rarely changing values.

table lock

A lock that prevents any other
**transaction** from accessing a
table. `InnoDB` makes considerable effort to
make such locks unnecessary, by using techniques such as
**online DDL**,
**row locks** and
**consistent reads** for processing
**DML** statements and
**queries**. You can create such a
lock through SQL using the `LOCK TABLE`
statement; one of the steps in migrating from other database
systems or MySQL storage engines is to remove such statements
wherever practical.


See Also [consistent read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_consistent_read), [DML](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dml), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking), [online DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_online_ddl), [query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_query), [row lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row_lock), [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

table statistics

See [statistics](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_statistics).

table type

Obsolete synonym for **storage**
**engine**. We refer to
[`InnoDB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables,
[`MyISAM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/myisam-storage-engine.html "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables, and so on.


See Also [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb), [storage engine](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_storage_engine).

tablespace

A data file that can hold data for one or more
`InnoDB` **tables** and associated
**indexes**.


The **system tablespace** contains
the `InnoDB` **data**
**dictionary**, and prior to MySQL 5.6 holds all other
`InnoDB` tables by default.


The [`innodb_file_per_table`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table)
option, enabled by default in MySQL 5.6 and higher, allows
tables to be created in their own tablespaces. File-per-table
tablespaces support features such as efficient storage of
**off-page columns**, table
compression, and transportable tablespaces. See
[Section 17.6.3.2, “File-Per-Table Tablespaces”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-file-per-table-tablespaces.html "17.6.3.2 File-Per-Table Tablespaces") for details.


`InnoDB` introduced general tablespaces in
MySQL 5.7.6. General tablespaces are shared tablespaces created
using [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-tablespace.html "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax.
They can be created outside of the MySQL data directory, are
capable of holding multiple tables, and support tables of all
row formats.


MySQL NDB Cluster also groups its tables into tablespaces. See
[Section 25.6.11.1, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data-objects.html "25.6.11.1 NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects") for details.

Tcl

A programming language originating in the Unix scripting world.
Sometimes extended by code written in
**C**,
**C++**, or
**Java**. For the open-source Tcl
**API** for MySQL, see
[Section 31.12, “MySQL Tcl API”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/apis-tcl.html "31.12 MySQL Tcl API").


See Also [API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_api).

temporary table

A **table** whose data does not
need to be truly permanent. For example, temporary tables might
be used as storage areas for intermediate results in complicated
calculations or transformations; this intermediate data would
not need to be recovered after a crash. Database products can
take various shortcuts to improve the performance of operations
on temporary tables, by being less scrupulous about writing data
to disk and other measures to protect the data across restarts.


Sometimes, the data itself is removed automatically at a set
time, such as when the transaction ends or when the session
ends. With some database products, the table itself is removed
automatically too.


See Also [table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_table).

temporary tablespace

`InnoDB` uses two types of temporary
tablespace. _Session temporary tablespaces_
store user-created temporary tables and internal temporary
tables created by the optimizer. The _global temporary_
_tablespace_ stores _rollback_
_segments_ for changes made to user-created temporary
tables.


See Also [global temporary tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_global_temporary_tablespace), [session temporary tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_session_temporary_tablespace), [temporary table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_temporary_table).

text collection

The set of columns included in a **FULLTEXT**
**index**.


See Also [FULLTEXT index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_fulltext_index).

TGS

A Kerberos ticket-granting server. TGS can also refer to the
ticket-granting service provided by a ticket-granting server.


See Also [ticket-granting server](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ticket_granting_server).

TGT

See [ticket-granting ticket](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ticket_granting_ticket).

thread

A unit of processing that is typically more lightweight than a
**process**, allowing for greater
**concurrency**.


See Also [concurrency](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_concurrency), [master thread](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_master_thread), [process](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_process), [Pthreads](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_pthreads).

ticket-granting server

In Kerberos, a server that provides tickets. The ticket-granting
server (TGS) combined with an authentication server (AS) make up
a key distribution center (KDC).


TGS can also refer to the ticket-granting service provided by
the ticket-granting server.


See Also [authentication server](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_authentication_server), [key distribution center](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_key_distribution_center).

ticket-granting ticket

In Kerberos, a ticket-granting ticket is presented to the
ticket-granting server (TGS) to obtain service tickets for
service access.


See Also [ticket-granting server](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ticket_granting_server).

Tomcat

An open source **J2EE** application
server, implementing the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages
programming technologies. Consists of a web server and Java
servlet container. With MySQL, typically used in conjunction
with **Connector/J**.


See Also [J2EE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_j2ee).

torn page

An error condition that can occur due to a combination of I/O
device configuration and hardware failure. If data is written
out in chunks smaller than the `InnoDB` **page size** (by default, 16KB), a
hardware failure while writing could result in only part of a
page being stored to disk. The `InnoDB` **doublewrite buffer** guards
against this possibility.


See Also [doublewrite buffer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_doublewrite_buffer).

TPS

Acronym for “**transactions**
per second”, a unit of measurement sometimes used in
benchmarks. Its value depends on the
**workload** represented by a
particular benchmark test, combined with factors that you
control such as the hardware capacity and database
configuration.


See Also [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction), [workload](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_workload).

transaction

Transactions are atomic units of work that can be
**committed** or
**rolled back**. When a transaction
makes multiple changes to the database, either all the changes
succeed when the transaction is committed, or all the changes
are undone when the transaction is rolled back.


Database transactions, as implemented by
`InnoDB`, have properties that are collectively
known by the acronym **ACID**, for
atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.


See Also [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid), [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [isolation level](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_isolation_level), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback).

transaction ID

An internal field associated with each
**row**. This field is physically
changed by [`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
[`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operations to record which
**transaction** has locked the row.


See Also [implicit row lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_implicit_row_lock), [row](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_row), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

transparent page compression

A feature added in MySQL 5.7.8 that permits page-level
compression for `InnoDB` tables that reside in
**file-per-table** tablespaces.
Page compression is enabled by specifying the
`COMPRESSION` attribute with
[`CREATE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table.html "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"). For more
information, see [Section 17.9.2, “InnoDB Page Compression”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-page-compression.html "17.9.2 InnoDB Page Compression").


See Also [file-per-table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_file_per_table), [hole punching](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hole_punching), [sparse file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sparse_file).

transportable tablespace

A feature that allows a
**tablespace** to be moved from one
instance to another. Traditionally, this has not been possible
for `InnoDB` tablespaces because all table data
was part of the **system**
**tablespace**. In MySQL 5.6 and higher, the
[`FLUSH\\
        TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/flush.html#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) syntax prepares an
`InnoDB` table for copying to another server;
running [`ALTER TABLE\\
        ... DISCARD TABLESPACE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") and
[`ALTER TABLE ...\\
        IMPORT TABLESPACE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") on the other server brings the
copied data file into the other instance. A separate
**.cfg file**, copied along with
the **.ibd file**, is used to
update the table metadata (for example the
**space ID**) as the tablespace is
imported. See [Section 17.6.1.3, “Importing InnoDB Tables”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-table-import.html "17.6.1.3 Importing InnoDB Tables") for usage
information.


See Also [.cfg file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cfg_file), [.ibd file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ibd_file), [space ID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_space_id), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace), [tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_tablespace).

troubleshooting

The process of determining the source of a problem. Some of the
resources for troubleshooting MySQL problems include:

- [Section 2.9.2.1, “Troubleshooting Problems Starting the MySQL Server”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/starting-server-troubleshooting.html "2.9.2.1 Troubleshooting Problems Starting the MySQL Server")

- [Section 17.21, “InnoDB Troubleshooting”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-troubleshooting.html "17.21 InnoDB Troubleshooting").


truncate

A **DDL** operation that removes
the entire contents of a table, while leaving the table and
related indexes intact. Contrast with
**drop**. Although conceptually it
has the same result as a `DELETE` statement
with no `WHERE` clause, it operates differently
behind the scenes: `InnoDB` creates a new empty
table, drops the old table, then renames the new table to take
the place of the old one. Because this is a DDL operation, it
cannot be **rolled back**.


If the table being truncated contains
**foreign keys** that reference
another table, the truncation operation uses a slower method of
operation, deleting one row at a time so that corresponding rows
in the referenced table can be deleted as needed by any
`ON DELETE CASCADE` clause. (MySQL 5.5 and
higher do not allow this slower form of truncate, and return an
error instead if foreign keys are involved. In this case, use a
`DELETE` statement instead.


See Also [DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ddl), [drop](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_drop), [foreign key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_foreign_key), [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback).

truststore

See Also [SSL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ssl).

tuple

A technical term designating an ordered set of elements. It is
an abstract notion, used in formal discussions of database
theory. In the database field, tuples are usually represented by
the columns of a table row. They could also be represented by
the result sets of queries, for example, queries that retrieved
only some columns of a table, or columns from joined tables.


See Also [cursor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cursor).

two-phase commit

An operation that is part of a distributed
**transaction**, under the
**XA** specification. (Sometimes
abbreviated as 2PC.) When multiple databases participate in the
transaction, either all databases
**commit** the changes, or all
databases **roll back** the
changes.

See Also [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction), [XA](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_xa).

### U

undo

Data that is maintained throughout the life of a
**transaction**, recording all
changes so that they can be undone in case of a
**rollback** operation. It is
stored in **undo logs** either
within the **system tablespace**
(in MySQL 5.7 or earlier) or in separate
**undo tablespaces**. As of MySQL
8.0, undo logs reside in undo tablespaces by default.


See Also [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback), [rollback segment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback_segment), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction), [undo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log), [undo tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_tablespace).

undo buffer

See [undo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log).

undo log

A storage area that holds copies of data modified by active
**transactions**. If another
transaction needs to see the original data (as part of a
**consistent read** operation), the
unmodified data is retrieved from this storage area.


In MySQL 5.6 and MySQL 5.7, you can use the
[`innodb_undo_tablespaces`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_undo_tablespaces)
variable have undo logs reside in **undo**
**tablespaces**, which can be placed on another storage
device such as an **SSD**. In MySQL
8.0, undo logs reside in two default undo tablespaces that are
created when MySQL is initialized, and additional undo
tablespaces can be created using
[`CREATE UNDO\\
        TABLESPACE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-tablespace.html "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax.


The undo log is split into separate portions, the
**insert undo buffer** and the
**update undo buffer**.


See Also [consistent read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_consistent_read), [rollback segment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback_segment), [SSD](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ssd), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction), [undo tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_tablespace).

undo log segment

A collection of **undo logs**. Undo
log segments exists within **rollback**
**segments**. An undo log segment might contain undo logs
from multiple transactions. An undo log segment can only be used
by one transaction at a time but can be reused after it is
released at transaction **commit**
or **rollback**. May also be
referred to as an “undo segment”.


See Also [commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_commit), [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback), [rollback segment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback_segment), [undo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log).

undo tablespace

An undo tablespace contains **undo**
**logs**. Undo logs exist within
**undo log segments**, which are
contained within **rollback**
**segments**. Rollback segments have traditionally
resided in the system tablespace. As of MySQL 5.6, rollback
segments can reside in undo tablespaces. In MySQL 5.6 and MySQL
5.7, the number of undo tablespaces is controlled by the
[`innodb_undo_tablespaces`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_undo_tablespaces)
configuration option. In MySQL 8.0, two default undo tablespaces
are created when the MySQL instance is initialized, and
additional undo tablespaces can be created using
[`CREATE UNDO\\
        TABLESPACE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-tablespace.html "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax.


For more information, see
[Section 17.6.3.4, “Undo Tablespaces”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-undo-tablespaces.html "17.6.3.4 Undo Tablespaces").


See Also [rollback segment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback_segment), [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_system_tablespace), [undo log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log), [undo log segment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log_segment).

Unicode

A system for supporting national characters, character sets,
code pages, and other internationalization aspects in a flexible
and standardized way.


Unicode support is an important aspect of the
**ODBC** standard.
**Connector/ODBC** 5.1 is a Unicode
driver, as opposed to Connector/ODBC 3.51, which is an
**ANSI** driver.


See Also [ANSI](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_ansi), [Connector/ODBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_connector_odbc), [ODBC](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_odbc).

unique constraint

A kind of **constraint** that
asserts that a column cannot contain any duplicate values. In
terms of **relational** algebra, it
is used to specify 1-to-1 relationships. For efficiency in
checking whether a value can be inserted (that is, the value
does not already exist in the column), a unique constraint is
supported by an underlying **unique**
**index**.


See Also [constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_constraint), [relational](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_relational), [unique index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_unique_index).

unique index

An index on a column or set of columns that have a
**unique constraint**. Because the
index is known not to contain any duplicate values, certain
kinds of lookups and count operations are more efficient than in
the normal kind of index. Most of the lookups against this type
of index are simply to determine if a certain value exists or
not. The number of values in the index is the same as the number
of rows in the table, or at least the number of rows with
non-null values for the associated columns.


**Change buffering** optimization
does not apply to unique indexes. As a workaround, you can
temporarily set `unique_checks=0` while doing a
bulk data load into an `InnoDB` table.


See Also [cardinality](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cardinality), [change buffering](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_change_buffering), [unique constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_unique_constraint), [unique key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_unique_key).

unique key

The set of columns (one or more) comprising a
**unique index**. When you can
define a `WHERE` condition that matches exactly
one row, and the query can use an associated unique index, the
lookup and error handling can be performed very efficiently.


See Also [cardinality](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cardinality), [unique constraint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_unique_constraint), [unique index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_unique_index).

UPN

See [user principal name](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_user_principal_name).

user principal name

The name for a Kerberos named entity that represents a user.

See Also [principal](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_principal).

### V

variable-length type

A data type of variable length.
[`VARCHAR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/char.html "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARBINARY`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/binary-varbinary.html "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), and
[`BLOB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
[`TEXT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types are variable-length
types.


`InnoDB` treats fixed-length fields greater
than or equal to 768 bytes in length as variable-length fields,
which can be stored **off-page**.
For example, a `CHAR(255)` column can exceed
768 bytes if the maximum byte length of the character set is
greater than 3, as it is with `utf8mb4`.


See Also [off-page column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_off_page_column), [overflow page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_overflow_page).

victim

The **transaction** that is
automatically chosen to be **rolled**
**back** when a **deadlock**
is detected. `InnoDB` rolls back the
transaction that has updated the fewest rows.


**Deadlock detection** can be
disabled using the
[`innodb_deadlock_detect`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_deadlock_detect)
configuration option.


See Also [deadlock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_deadlock), [deadlock detection](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_deadlock_detection), [innodb\_lock\_wait\_timeout](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_innodb_lock_wait_timeout), [transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_transaction).

view

A stored query that when invoked produces a result set. A view
acts as a virtual table.


virtual column

See [virtual generated column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_virtual_generated_column).

virtual generated column

A column whose values are computed from an expression included
in the column definition. Column values are not stored, but are
evaluated when rows are read, immediately after any
`BEFORE` triggers. A virtual generated column
takes no storage. `InnoDB` supports secondary
indexes on virtual generated columns.


Contrast with **stored generated**
**column**.


See Also [base column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_base_column), [generated column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_generated_column), [stored generated column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_stored_generated_column).

virtual index

A virtual index is a **secondary**
**index** on one or more **virtual**
**generated columns** or on a combination of virtual
generated columns and regular columns or stored generated
columns. For more information, see
[Section 15.1.20.9, “Secondary Indexes and Generated Columns”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-secondary-indexes.html "15.1.20.9 Secondary Indexes and Generated Columns").


See Also [secondary index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_secondary_index), [stored generated column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_stored_generated_column), [virtual generated column](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_virtual_generated_column).

### W

wait

When an operation, such as acquiring a
**lock**,
**mutex**, or
**latch**, cannot be completed
immediately, `InnoDB` pauses and tries again.
The mechanism for pausing is elaborate enough that this
operation has its own name, the
**wait**. Individual threads are
paused using a combination of internal `InnoDB`
scheduling, operating system `wait()` calls,
and short-duration **spin** loops.


On systems with heavy load and many transactions, you might use
the output from the `SHOW INNODB STATUS`
command or **Performance Schema**
to determine whether threads are spending too much time waiting,
and if so, how you can improve
**concurrency**.


See Also [concurrency](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_concurrency), [latch](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_latch), [lock](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lock), [mutex](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_mutex), [Performance Schema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_performance_schema), [spin](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_spin).

warm backup

A **backup** taken while the
database is running, but that restricts some database operations
during the backup process. For example, tables might become
read-only. For busy applications and websites, you might prefer
a **hot backup**.


See Also [backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_backup), [cold backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cold_backup), [hot backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_hot_backup).

warm up

To run a system under a typical
**workload** for some time after
startup, so that the **buffer**
**pool** and other memory regions are filled as they
would be under normal conditions. This process happens naturally
over time when a MySQL server is restarted or subjected to a new
workload.


Typically, you run a workload for some time to warm up the
buffer pool before running performance tests, to ensure
consistent results across multiple runs; otherwise, performance
might be artificially low during the first run.


In MySQL 5.6, you can speed up the warmup process by enabling
the
[`innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown)
and
[`innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup)
configuration options, to bring the contents of the buffer pool
back into memory after a restart. These options are enabled by
default in MySQL 5.7. See
[Section 17.8.3.6, “Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-preload-buffer-pool.html "17.8.3.6 Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State").


See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [workload](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_workload).

workload

The combination and volume of
**SQL** and other database
operations, performed by a database application during typical
or peak usage. You can subject the database to a particular
workload during performance testing to identify
**bottlenecks**, or during capacity
planning.


See Also [bottleneck](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_bottleneck), [CPU-bound](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_cpu_bound), [disk-bound](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_disk_bound), [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_sql).

write combining

An optimization technique that reduces write operations when
**dirty pages** are
**flushed** from the
`InnoDB` **buffer**
**pool**. If a row in a page is updated multiple times,
or multiple rows on the same page are updated, all of those
changes are stored to the data files in a single write operation
rather than one write for each change.

See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [dirty page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dirty_page), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush).

### X

XA

A standard interface for coordinating distributed
**transactions**, allowing multiple
databases to participate in a transaction while maintaining
**ACID** compliance. For full
details, see [Section 15.3.8, “XA Transactions”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/xa.html "15.3.8 XA Transactions").


XA Distributed Transaction support is enabled by default.

### Y

young

A characteristic of a **page** in
the `InnoDB` **buffer**
**pool** meaning that it has been accessed recently, and
so is moved within the buffer pool data structure, so that it is
not **flushed** too soon by the
**LRU** algorithm. This term is
used in some **INFORMATION\_SCHEMA**
column names of tables related to the buffer pool.

See Also [buffer pool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_buffer_pool), [flush](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_flush), [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_information_schema), [LRU](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_lru), [page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_page).
