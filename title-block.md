[Go to the List of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

Title block (formerly known as Post Title block) displays the title of a post or page. This block is primarily nested inside a [query loop](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/query-loop-block/) block and helps to customize the appearance of the query loop.

See [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/work-with-blocks/) for a description of how to use blocks in general and each component such as toolbars, settings panel, etc.
