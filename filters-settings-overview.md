Use the filter settings to change image appearance with a duotone overlay.

To apply a filter to an image, add a block containing an image — some examples are the [Image Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/image-block/) or the [Cover Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/).

Refer to this article for [detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/).

## [Using filters](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/filters-settings-overview/\#using-filters)

While using a block with image, you can go to the **Style** tab and select a filter.

The filter options provide several duotone preset to choose from. Alternatively, you can set the color for shadows and highlights yourself by clicking the color bar.

## [Adding to Global Styles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/filters-settings-overview/\#adding-to-global-styles)

It is also possible to add filters to Global Styles — you can see more about that on the [Styles Overview](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/) page.

When selecting a block containing an image on Global Styles, you have the option to apply a specific filter by default on all existing and new images.

## [Reset options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/filters-settings-overview/\#reset-options)

While using the filter, you also have the option to revert whatever you want — this allow you to try and revert to experiement the image in different ways. To do so, click the **Filters options** button and select **Reset all**.
