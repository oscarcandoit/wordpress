[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The _Columns Block_ allows you to insert text, media, and other types of content into columns – limit 6. When used one after another, the columns can create a grid effect.

You can type _/_ columns and hit enter in a new paragraph block to add one quickly.

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)

Once you add the _Columns Block_, you can choose a variation to start with (and you can change the number or add more columns later). If you want to use the default variation (50 / 50), you can click on the _Skip_ option at the bottom.

![Columns block placeholder](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image14.png)

## [Adding and removing columns](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#adding-and-removing-columns)

It is possible to add or remove columns. To do so, click outside the box, between the box and the sidebar, then change the number of columns (up to six is recommended). Alternatively, you can adjust the number of columns in the block setting section.

![The demonstration of adding columns block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/columns.gif)

## [Adding content to the columns](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#adding-content-to-the-columns)

Once you have defined the number of columns, you can add content to each column. The amazing thing about the columns block is that you can add other blocks into each of the columns.

For instance, you can use the _Columns Block_ as the structure and add an image, heading, and paragraph block to create a grid of services.

![Using the columns block with images](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image4-1.png)

Or you can use the _Columns Block_ with the _Cover Block_ to feature pages of your site.

![Using the columns block with cover block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image7-1.png)

You could also use the _Columns Block_ with the _Button Block_ to invite users to take some actions on your site.

![Using the columns block for buttons layout](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image8.png)

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#block-toolbar)

Most blocks have their own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The _Columns Block_ shows the following buttons:

- Transform to
- Moving handles
- Change alignment
- Change vertical alignment
- More options

![Columns block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image17.png)

### [Transform to](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#transform-to)

You can transform columns into a _Group_ block.

![The transform options on the columns block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image9.png)

The _Group_ would give you the ability to change the background color around the columns.

![Using group block to give background color](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image1-1.png)

It’s also possible to _unwrap_ the contents of _Columns_ block

### [Moving handles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#moving-handles)

The dotted icons can be used to drag and drop a block to the place of your choosing. The up and down arrow icons can be used to shift a block up and down in your document.

![The block moving tools on the columns block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image11.png)

[Get more information about moving a block within the editor.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/moving-blocks/)

### [Change alignment](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#change-alignment)

![The alignment tools on the columns block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image6-1.png)

- **None**
- **Wide width** – Increase the width of the block beyond the content size.
- **Full width** – Extend the block to cover the full width of the screen.

### [Change vertical alignment](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#change-vertical-alignment)

![The vertical alignment tools on the columns block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image13.png)

- **Align top** – Make the block vertically aligned top.
- **Align middle** – Make the block vertically aligned middle.
- **Align bottom** – Make the block vertically aligned bottom.

### [Options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#options)

The Options button on a block toolbar gives you more features to customize the block.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#block-settings)

The block settings panel contains customization options specific to the block. To open it, select the block and click the _Settings_ button next to the _Publish_ button.

![The block settings button](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image5.png)

Note that since the _Columns Block_ has the ability to embed other blocks if you click specifically on one of the columns, the settings in the sidebar will change according to the block you added to the selected column (e.g. if you added an image to one of the columns when you click on the image the sidebar will display the options from the _Image Block_ settings).

Here are the options for the _Columns_ block:

### [Columns](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#columns)

In the _Columns_ settings, you can set the number of columns ( **1** to **6**). You can edit the number of columns by clicking on the up and down arrows, dragging the slider to the right or left, or by typing the number directly in the field.

![Column number settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image3-1.png)

It’s also possible to change the _Color_, _Typography,_ _Dimensions,_ and _Border_ settings. To access them, open the _Styles_ section:

![Styles tab](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image10.png)

### [Color](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#color)

With _Color settings_, you can change the color of the text in your block, the color of links, and the background color of your block. For the columns block, this means that you can style each column individually or both columns for consistency.

[See this guide for more information about changing colors.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/)

### [Typography](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#typography)

The _Columns_ block provides typography settings to change the font family, appearance, line height, letter spacing, decoration, letter case, and font size.

For details, refer to this support article: [Typography settings overview](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/)

### [Dimensions](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#dimensions)

The _Columns_ blockprovides dimension settings options to add padding, margin, and block spacing.

The _Advanced_ tab lets you add HTML anchor and CSS class(es) to your block.

![Advanced section](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image2-1.png)

_HTML anchor_ allows you to [make a unique web address](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-jumps/) for a particular _Columns Block_. Then, you’ll be able to link directly to a _Columns Block_ of your page.

The _Additional CSS class(es)_ lets you add CSS class(es) to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.

### [For individual Column Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/\#for-individual-column-blocks)

For individual _Column_ Blocks within the _Columns_ Block, you can customize the width options as shown below. To make it easier to find and select the Column Block, [it’s recommended to use List View](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/list-view/).

The width option allows you to set the width of the individual column itself, in [PX, %, EM, REM, VW or VH](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/#units-explained).

![Column width settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image16.png)
