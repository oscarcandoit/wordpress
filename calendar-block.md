# Calendar Block

[↑ Back to top](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/calendar-block/#wp--skip-link--target)

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The _Calendar block_ displays your posts in a calendar format. When you publish a new post, it is automatically added to the Calendar block. If you click on a date, it will open the archive of posts published on that date.

The _Calendar block_ does not let you create a calendar of events. For that, you need an Events calendar plugin.

By default, it shows the current month and links to the posts published on various days in that month.

To add a _Calendar block_, click on the **Block Inserter** icon. You can also type ` /calendar` and hit enter in a new _paragraph block_ to add one quickly.
