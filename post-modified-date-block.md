[Go to the list of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

Use the Post Modified Date block to display the date the post was last modified. This block is primarily used in a [template](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/) or nested inside a [query loop](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/query-loop-block/) block.

On the front of your website, this block only shows if you have modified the content after publishing. This means you can combine it with the [Post Date block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-date-block/) to show the publishing date and the last modified date.

To add a Post Modified Date block, click the **Block Inserter** icon when editing the page template. Search for the Post Modified Date block. Click on it to add the block to your page template.

You can also type /post mod and hit enter in a new paragraph block to quickly add the Post Modified Date block.
