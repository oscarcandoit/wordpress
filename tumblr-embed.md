With the Tumblr Embed block, you can embed several types of posts from the microblogging platform.

The post needs to be public to embed. It cannot be a standalone image (with the URL name.tumblr.com/image). You can, however, embed image posts (with the URL name.tumblr.com/post/etc) and the rest of Tumblr’s post types including: Text, Quote, Link, Chat, Audio and Video.

An Example:

If you are looking to [import your Tumblr posts into WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/importing-content/#tumblr), there is a process in the Tools section of your Dashboard.

Steps to embed a Tumblr post

1. You need to find the link to the post. The easiest way to do this is to click on the three dots in the lower-right corner of the post and select Permalink.

2. Copy the URL at the top of your browser. On a PC, press CTRL+A in the URL field and then CTRL+C to copy the URL. On a Mac, press ⌘+ A and then ⌘+C.
3. Go to your post or page.
4. Add the Tumblr block.

5. Paste the link in the text box and click the “Embed” button.

6. If the link can be embedded, you will see a preview in your editor.

If you cannot use that URL, an error message will popup saying “Sorry, this content could not be embedded.”

![Example of a URL that cannot be embedded. Two options are presented, try again or convert to link.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/image-10.png)

If this happens you can: Try again with a different URL or convert it to a link.

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/tumblr-embed/\#block-toolbar)

Besides the Mover and Drag & Drop Handle, the Block Toolbar for the Tumblr embed shows four buttons:

You can transform a Tumblr embed to a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the Tumblr embed.
