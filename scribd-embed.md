By using the _Scribd embed block_, you can embed various articles, e-books, or research papers into your posts and pages. You don’t need a Scribd account to embed an article, although what you are embedding needs to be public.

## [Steps to embed an article from Scribd](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/scribd-embed/\#steps-to-embed-an-article-from-scribd)

1. On the Scribd app, click on the article that you want to embed in your post/page & click on the “Embed” option

![A test article shown in Scribd with "Embed" highlighted.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Scribd-Embed-HelpHub-SS-2-1-1024x636.png)

2. After clicking on the “Embed” option, a pop-up will appear with several options:

![The pop up Embed panel with options.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Scribd-Embed-HelpHub-SS-3.png)

It contains several options for you to choose from. Here you can choose the size of your article/e-book, choose the page number it starts from, as well as see a preview of your document.

3. After altering the options in the pop-up as per your needs, copy the URL on the top of this pop-up

4. Add a Scribd Embed block to your page or post by clicking on the **(+)** Block Inserter icon and selecting the _Scribd block_.. Alternatively, you can type `/scribd` and press `enter`.

If you use a URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message _“Sorry, this content could not be embedded.”_

In that case, you’ll have two choices: Try again with a different URL or Convert to a link.

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/scribd-embed/\#block-toolbar)

Besides the Mover and Drag & Drop Handle, the Block Toolbar for the Scribd embed shows four buttons:

![Block Toolbar with options available for the Scribd Block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Scribd-Embed-HelpHub-SS-9.png)

- Transform to
- Change alignment
- Edit URL, and
- More Options.

**Transform to:**

![Options to transform the Scribd block to Paragraph, Columns or Group.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Scribd-Embed-HelpHub-SS-10.png)

You can transform a Scribd embed into a Paragraph, Group, or Column. Transforming it into a Group would give you the ability to change the background color and other settings of the Scribd embed, as shown below:

![Example of transforming Scribd block to group and updating the background and text color of the group.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Scribd-Embed-HelpHub-SS-11.png)

**Change alignment**

![Alignment options for the Scribd block: wide width, full width, align left, align center, and align right.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Scribd-Embed-HelpHub-SS-12.png)

- **Wide width** – Increase the width of the block beyond the content size
- **Full width** – extend the Scribd block to cover the full width of the screen.
- **Align left** – Make the Scribd block left aligned
- **Align center** – Make the Scribd block alignment centered
- **Align right**– Make the Scribd block align right

_“Wide width” and “Full width” alignment need to be enabled by the Theme of your site._

**Edit URL**

Via the edit URL, you can change the Scribd Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the “Embed” Button.

![Editing the Scribd block URL via the "edit" option.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Scribd-Embed-HelpHub-SS-13.png)

**More options:**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/scribd-embed/\#block-settings)

Besides the Advanced section, the Scribd embed has only one other setting in the “Block Settings” sidebar: Media Settings.

**Media Settings**

![Media settings for the Scribd embed block with the toggle OFF for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Scribd-Embed-HelpHub-SS-15.png)

![Media settings for the Scribd embed block with the toggle ON for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Scribd-Embed-HelpHub-SS-16.png)

Via the _Media Settings_ you can control the behavior of your embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position, the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The “Advanced” tab lets you add CSS class(es) to your block.

![Additional CSS Class(es) option for the Scribd Embed block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/image-77.png)

The “Additional CSS class(es)” lets you add CSS class(es) to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
