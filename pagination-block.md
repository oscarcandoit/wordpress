[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The **Pagination** blockdisplays paginated navigation to the next/previous set of posts, when applicable. This block is located inside a [Query Loop](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/query-loop-block/) block and lets you customize the layout and appearance of the navigation.

![Pagination Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-07-at-3.26.15%E2%80%AFPM.png)

A **Pagination** block is included by default if you choose a correct pattern in a Query Loop block. That said, you can also insert it manually when needed.

Click the **add block** ( **+**) icon inside the Query Loop block to open the **block inserter** pop-up window and search for the **Pagination** block.

You can also use the keyboard shortcut `/pagination` in a new paragraph block followed by `enter` to insert a block quickly.
