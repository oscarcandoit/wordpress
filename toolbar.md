# Toolbar

[↑ Back to top](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/toolbar/#wp--skip-link--target)

The **Toolbar** is an area of the screen just above the site that lists useful administration screen links such as add a new post or edit your profile.

![Admin Bar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/admin_bar-1024x26.png)Toolbar

The Toolbar contains links to information about WordPress, as well as
quick-links to create new posts, pages and links, add new users, review
comments, and alerts to available updates to plugins and themes on your
site.

The toolbar can be turned on/off from the **Toolbar** option in [Administration](https://wordpress.org/support/article/administration-screens/) \> [Users](https://wordpress.org/support/article/administration-screens/#users-your-blogging-family) \> [Your Profile](https://wordpress.org/support/article/users-your-profile-screen/), but It is no longer possible to hide the Toolbar when viewing the [Administration Screens](https://wordpress.org/support/article/administration-screens/).

**Note:** If you have turned the Toolbar on in your profile settings, but still don’t see it on the front end of your site, it may be that your theme does not call wp\_footer() in its footer.php file, or the Toolbar may be disabled by a plugin.
