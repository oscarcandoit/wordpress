# Navbar examples

This example is a quick exercise to illustrate how the navbar and its contents work. Some navbars extend the width of the viewport, others are confined within a `.container`. For positioning of navbars, checkout the [top](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/navbar-static/) and [fixed top](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/navbar-fixed/) examples.

At the smallest breakpoint, the collapse plugin is used to hide the links and show a menu button to toggle the collapsed content.
