# Bootstrap and Masonry

Integrate [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/) with the Bootstrap grid system and cards component.

Masonry is not included in Bootstrap. Add it by including the JavaScript plugin manually, or using a CDN like so:

```

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha384-GNFwBvfVxBkLMJpYMOABq3c+d3KnQxudP/mGPkzpZSTYykLBNsZEnG2D9G/X/+7D" crossorigin="anonymous" async></script>

```

By adding `data-masonry='{"percentPosition": true }'` to the `.row` wrapper, we can combine the powers of Bootstrap's responsive grid and Masonry's positioning.
