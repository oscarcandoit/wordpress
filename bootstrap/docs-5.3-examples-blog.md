### From the Firehose

## Sample blog post

January 1, 2021 by [Mark](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/blog/#)

This blog post shows a few different types of content that’s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.

This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.

## Blockquotes

This is an example blockquote in action:

> Quoted text goes here.

This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.

### Example lists

This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:

- First list item
- Second list item with a longer description
- Third list item to close it out

And this is an ordered list:

1. First list item
2. Second list item with a longer description
3. Third list item to close it out

And this is a definition list:

HyperText Markup Language (HTML)The language used to describe and define the content of a Web pageCascading Style Sheets (CSS)Used to describe the appearance of Web contentJavaScript (JS)The programming language used to build advanced Web sites and applications

## Inline HTML elements

HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

- **To bold text**, use `<strong>`.
- _To italicize text_, use `<em>`.
- Abbreviations, like HTML should use `<abbr>`, with an optional `title` attribute for the full phrase.
- Citations, like — Mark Otto, should use `<cite>`.
- ~~Deleted~~ text should use `<del>` and inserted text should use `<ins>`.
- Superscript text uses `<sup>` and subscript text uses `<sub>`.

Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.

## Heading

### Sub-heading

| --- | --- | --- |
| Alice | 10 | 11 |
| Bob | 4 | 3 |
| Charlie | 7 | 9 |
| Totals | 21 | 23 |
