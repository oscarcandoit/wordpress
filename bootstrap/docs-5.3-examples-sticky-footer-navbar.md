# Sticky footer with fixed navbar

Pin a footer to the bottom of the viewport in desktop browsers with this custom HTML and CSS. A fixed navbar has been added with `padding-top: 60px;` on the `main > .container`.

Back to [the default sticky footer](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/sticky-footer/) minus the navbar.
