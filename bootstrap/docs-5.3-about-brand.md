Have a need for Bootstrap’s brand resources? Great! We have only a few guidelines we follow, and in turn ask you to follow as well.

## Logo [Link to this section: Logo](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/about/brand/\#logo)

When referencing Bootstrap, use our logo mark. Do not modify our logos in any way. Do not use Bootstrap’s branding for your own open or closed source projects.

Our logo mark is also available in black and white. All rules for our primary logo apply to these as well.

## Name [Link to this section: Name](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/about/brand/\#name)

Bootstrap should always be referred to as just **Bootstrap**. No capital _s_.

Bootstrap

**Correct**

BootStrap

**Incorrect**
