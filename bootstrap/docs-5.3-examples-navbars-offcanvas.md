# Navbar with offcanvas examples

This example shows how responsive offcanvas menus work within the navbar. For positioning of navbars, checkout the [top](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/navbar-static/) and [fixed top](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/navbar-fixed/) examples.

From the top down, you'll see a dark navbar, light navbar and a responsive navbar—each with offcanvases built in. Resize your browser window to the large breakpoint to see the toggle for the offcanvas.
