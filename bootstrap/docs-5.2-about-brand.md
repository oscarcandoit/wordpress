Have a need for Bootstrap’s brand resources? Great! We have only a few guidelines we follow, and in turn ask you to follow as well.

## Logo [Link to this section: Logo](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/about/brand/\#logo)

When referencing Bootstrap, use our logo mark. Do not modify our logos in any way. Do not use Bootstrap’s branding for your own open or closed source projects. **Do not use the Twitter name or logo** in association with Bootstrap.

Our logo mark is also available in black and white. All rules for our primary logo apply to these as well.

## Name [Link to this section: Name](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/about/brand/\#name)

Bootstrap should always be referred to as just **Bootstrap**. No Twitter before it and no capital _s_.
