2. Search for the Post Featured Image **block**.
3. Click on it to add the block to your Post Template.

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-featured-image-block/\#block-toolbar)

To view the block toolbar, click on the block and the toolbar will be displayed.

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons. These block-specific controls allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The Post Featured Image block shows six buttons in the block toolbar:

- Transform to
- Drag icon
- Move handles
- Apply duotone filter
- Change alignment
- More options

### [Apply duotone filter](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-featured-image-block/\#apply-duotone-filter)

You can create a two-tone color effect (called the duotone effect) on the featured image without actually changing the original image. The duotone effect works best on high-contrast images.

You can pick the two colors for the effect from the list of six duotone presets provided in the drop-down.

1. Foreground and background
2. Foreground and secondary
3. Foreground and tertiary
4. Primary and background
5. Primary and secondary
6. Primary and tertiary

These are based on the foreground, background, primary, secondary and tertiary colors set in the theme’s color palette.

![Apply duotone filter in the Post Featured Image block ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/12/image10.png)Apply duotone filter in the Post Featured Image block

You can also pick your own colors for the shadows and highlights by clicking on the Shadows /Highlights option which opens up the color picker and selecting your custom color from the color palette.

To clear all the changes you made, use the clear button at the bottom right corner.

**More option**

The More option on a block toolbar gives you more features to customize the block. You have the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-featured-image-block/\#block-settings)

Every block has specific options in the editor sidebar besides those found in the **Block Toolbar**. If you do not see the sidebar, click the ‘sidebar’ icon next to the **Publish** or **Update** button.

### [Link to post](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-featured-image-block/\#link-to-post)

Turn on the ‘Link to post’ button in the Block Settings to link the featured image to the URL of the post. This enables the website visitor to go to the post by clicking on the Featured image. There is also an option to open the link in a new tab and set link rel.

### [Styles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-featured-image-block/\#styles)

Styles settings can be found on a second tab in block settings.

#### [Color](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-featured-image-block/\#color)

Under color, options are available to set the overlay color and the opacity. Set the overlay color and adjust the opacity from 0 to 100, and you will notice its effect on the image.

It is also possible to use gradient as overlay if the theme supports gradient presets.

![Gradient overlay with 60% opacity](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/1508963/292544262-c3cda069-6fd4-4a54-8b6f-390c707fc3d8.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.AGx2yte2XqMrnrxYqrwYKoc_VOaWI_cBzRN6zyv1_pc)Gradient overlay with 60% opacity

#### [Filters](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-featured-image-block/\#filters)

Duotone Filters can also be set from style settings. It works the same as the option available under the Block Toolbar (mentioned above).

#### [Dimensions](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-featured-image-block/\#dimensions)

Dimension controls are used to control how groups of blocks are placed alongside one another by changing the values for padding, margin, and other dimensions.

Available dimensions controls

- Padding
- Margin
- Aspect Ratio – changes the shape of your image, which may resulted in changing the size as well.
- Height & Width

[Learn more about dimension controls.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/dimension-controls-overview/)

Depending on the theme settings, aspect ratio could be different.

#### [Border](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-featured-image-block/\#border)

Set the Border and Border radius of the image.

[Detailed instructions on Border controls](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/border-settings-overview/)

### [Advanced settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-featured-image-block/\#advanced-settings)

The “Advanced” tab lets you add CSS class(es) to your block. This will allow you to write custom CSS and styles to the block.

![Advanced option in the selected Block](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HCaeEAd-xkijY3husAGN8FkRfOokz6h-mLa1vQoT11JIf366WEE4Y3jtoy6CTOJGTpBZELgZPdIewg2ug8pURV5XtFciGwLHJiNwleOvlGte5WnWTug0SYe4p-qBR54_8oR1NwHM)Advanced option in the selected Block

## [Inside the site templates](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-featured-image-block/\#inside-the-site-templates)

Featured image block can be added and managed inside [site templates](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/), if the theme supports [the site editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/).

Block settings here have a little more options than in a post or page editor, such as scale settings.
