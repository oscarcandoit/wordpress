[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

With the Mixcloud Embed block, you can embed tracks, playlists, and profile from Mixcloud into your posts and pages. You don’t need a Mixcloud account to be able to use them, although they need to be public.

If you use an URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message _“Sorry, this content could not be embedded.”_

![Mixcloud URL cannot be embedded notification](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/08/image25.png)

You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or convert it to a link.

5. Click on “Preview” to see how it will look on the front-end

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/mixcloud-embed/\#block-toolbar)

Each block has its own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor. The _SoundCloud Embed block_ has the following options in the Block toolbar.

- Transform to
- Block moving tools
- Change alignment
- Edit URL, and
- More options.

![Block toolbar in relation to the Mixcloud embed](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/mixcloud-block-toolbar.png)

**Transform to**:

You can transform a _Mixcloud Embed block_ into a Paragraph, Columns, or a Group block.

![Block transform options for the Mixcloud embed](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/mixcloud-transform-options.png)

You can transform a Mixcloud embed into a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the Mixcloud embed.

Use the block-moving tools to move the block up and down inside the editor. Use the six dots icon to drag and drop the _Mixcloud Embed block_ and reposition it anywhere on the editor. Alternatively, click on the up and down arrows to move the block up or down the editor.

**Change alignment**

![Mixcloud alignment options from block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/mixcloud-alignment-options.png)

- **Align left** – Make the Mixcloud post left aligned
- **Align center** – Make the Mixcloud post alignment centered
- **Align right**– Make the Mixcloud post align right
- **Wide width** – Increase the width of the post beyond the content size
- **Full width** – Extend the Mixcloud post to cover the full width of the screen

“Wide width” and “Full width” alignment need to be enabled by the Theme of your site.

**Edit URL**

Via the edit URL, you can change the Mixcloud Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the “Embed” button.

![Mixcloud URL field in editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/mixcloud-url-update.png)

**More options**

The More Options menu represented by three vertical dots on the far right of the toolbar gives you more features such as the ability to duplicate, remove, or edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/mixcloud-embed/\#block-settings)

Besides the Advanced section, the Mixcloud embed has only one setting in the “Block Settings” sidebar: Media Settings.

**Media Settings**

![Resize option toggled on in embed block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/media-settings-resize-on-2.png)

![Resize option toggled off in embed block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/media-settings-resize-off-2.png)

Via the _Media Settings,_ you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position, the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

![Advanced settings in the Mixcloud Embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/pasted-image-0-21.png)

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
