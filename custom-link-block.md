[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The _Custom Link_ block allows you to embed a link, page, category, or another item in your Navigation section.

![WordPress editor block: Add link window with typed URL, toolbar, and options for updating the link.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/12/image4-3.png)

To embed a _Custom Link_, add the _Navigation_ block by clicking the **Block inserter** (+) icon or typing /navigation in the editor.

![The plus icon in the toolbar and the Navigation block selection option to add a Custom link block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/12/image8-3.png)

The _Add link_ field will appear after adding a _Navigation_ block. Type your URL or select from recent pages you used or created on WordPress. Hit enter to save the link.

You can insert multiple _Custom Link_ blocks in one **Navigation** section. Hit enter after editing one link, and a new _Add link_ field will appear. Every _Custom Link_ block can have a separate link and text settings.

Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/).

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/custom-link-block/\#block-toolbar)

Each block has its own toolbar, which contains unique controls that let you customize or configure the block. The _Custom Link_ block has the following options on its toolbar:

**Transform to**

You can transform your _Custom Link block_ to:

- Submenu, turning your link into a wrapped links list
- [Spacer](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/spacer-block/) for dividing multiple links with an empty block
- [Search](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/search-block/), creating a search bar
- Home link, linking to homepage of your website
- [Site logo](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-logo-block/) for adding your site logo
- [Social icons](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/social-icons/) for embedding buttons that lead to a selected social media platform

**Block moving tools**

You can reorder _Custom Link blocks_ inside a **Navigation** section. Use the toolbar to _move_ the items _left and righ_ t or _drag_ them to a new position.

For more information, explore the [Navigation block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/navigation-block/).

**Link tool**

The **Link** tool lets you edit your custom link block. You can edit _title_ and _custom URL_ and decide whether you want to open the link _in a new tab_.

**Adding submenu to a Custom Link block**

The next icon lets you build a submenu, where you can add links to a drop-down list.

![WordPress editor Submenu section in the Navigation block applied to the selected Custom Link with the options to type URL or select an item.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/12/image11-1.png)

**Text formatting**

Basic **Text formatting** is available for all _Custom Link_ blocks. Select your title (or a part of it) to make it _Bold, Italic_, or _Strikethrough_, or turn it into an _Inline image_ to cover your link with an illustration.

![WordPress Custom Link block toolbar with selected text formation and additional options unwrapped, followed by the edited block example.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/12/image9-1.png)

**More options**

The **Options** section opens block settings and a button to move to the _parent Navigation field_ section to update it. You can also _copy, duplicate, lock_, or _remove your Custom Link_. Like everywhere in the WordPress editor, you can undo actions using the **Ctrl+Z** (or **Command+Z** on macOS).

Details about **More options** can be found in this [support article](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/).

## [Block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/custom-link-block/\#block-settings)

Each link has its **Block settings** you can access by clicking the **settings** button on the upper-right corner of the editor or via **Options** in the toolbar.

**Link** **Settings**

**Link settings** section contains the following options:

- **Description** to display with your link if the selected theme includes that option.
- **Link title** to provide more information about the link for search engine optimization. Leave this field empty if you want the title used in URL settings to stay.
- **Link rel** to specify how your external link is related to the page you’re working on and if its authority should be higher than your website’s.

Refer to the [Navigation block documentation](https://wordpress.com/support/full-site-editing/theme-blocks/navigation-block/#link-settings) for more information.

**Typography**

The _Custom Link_ block provides typography settings to change the font family, appearance, line height, letter spacing, decoration, letter case, and font size.

For details refer to this support article: [Typography settings overview](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/)

**Advanced**

The **Advanced** section has the **Additional CSS classes(es)** option. You can integrate your custom style into a _Custom Link_ block by inserting your CSS Class name into this field.
