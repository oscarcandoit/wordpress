### [For the Gallery block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/gallery-block/\#for-the-gallery-block-2)

![Gallery block settings panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/2024-01-16_15-30.png)Showing settings for the Gallery block

You can choose how many columns your Gallery block can have.

Select between 1 column and 8 columns. Keep in mind that you can only select as many columns as you have images.

This means that if you add 4 images, you’ll be given the option for a maximum of 4 columns. This number will increase as you add more images until you reach the maximum of 8. Even if you add more images to the Gallery, you will not be able to add more than 8 columns.

Your images will automatically arrange themselves to look good no matter how many columns you select. Try changing the setting and see what you like best.

To change the setting you can either manually enter the number of columns you want or visually change the number by using the slider to drag the number up and down.

#### [Crop images](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/gallery-block/\#crop-images)

You can select whether or not you’d like all of your images to be cropped in your Gallery block.

This option is useful if you have images of varying sizes and shapes. Cropping them will make the images in each row of the gallery the same size. You can toggle this option on and off to see which way you prefer.

#### [Link to](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/gallery-block/\#link-to)

You have 3 options for linking the images in your gallery: Attachment Page, Media File, and None. This determines what happens when your visitors click on the images in your gallery. You can also add custom links for each image from the block toolbar of the selected image.

- **Attachment page**: Selecting this option will link the image to its WordPress media [attachment](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/inserting-images-into-posts-and-pages/#step-4-attachment-details) page. This is an informational page about your image, which includes the image, the caption, the image description, and a comment field.
- **Media file**: Selecting this option will link the image to the image file in the original size in a new browser window.
- **None**: Selecting this option will not link the image to anything.

#### [Image sizes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/gallery-block/\#image-sizes)

The _Image Size_ setting allows you to set all the images to the size you choose.

- **Thumbnail:** Displays a small thumbnail-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note, by default the Thumbnail size is a square, so some cropping of your original image may occur.
- **Medium:** Displays a medium-sized version of your image on the page/post. This is a good size to use with Left/Right alignments, as it leaves sufficient space for legible text to either side.
- **Large**: Displays a large-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note: WordPress will determine the width of the content column of your theme, and display the largest possible image for that space.
- **Full Size:** Displays a full-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note: WordPress will determine the width of the content column of your theme, and display the largest possible image for that space. If your original image is larger than this column width, the full size of the image may not be displayed.

_Note: For these images sizes to work, your theme needs to support them._

#### [Style Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/gallery-block/\#style-settings)

The Title attribute field is designed to describe the [role of the image on your page](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/dom.html#the-title-attribute). Many devices and browsers don’t display this text.

HTML anchor allows you to do “ [page jumping](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-jumps/)” to that specific image. Page jumping, also sometimes referred to as anchor links, is where you click a link and instantly get moved somewhere further up or down a long page.

To enable this, you put an HTML Anchor in your photo and create a link that jumps to the anchor.
