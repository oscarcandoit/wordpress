[Go to the list of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

WordPress 6.8 is set to introduce a new block called Query Total, enhancing the flexibility of the Query Loop block.

This new block displays the total number of results within a query, making it easier for users to showcase the number of posts retrieved by a query loop.

The Query Total block is designed to be used inside a Query Loop block. It automatically counts the total number of posts retrieved by the query and displays the result in a user-friendly manner. For example, if a Query Loop retrieves 12 posts, the Query Total block will display:

_**Note:**_ You can only insert the Query Total Block inside a Query Loop block.

To add a _Query Total block_, click the **Block Inserter** icon when editing in the Query Loop.

Click on it to add the block to your page template.You can also use the keyboard shortcut `/query-total` to quickly insert the _Query Total block_:
