[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The **Page List** block allows you to display your website’s published pages in a page, post, and sidebar.

To add a **Page List** block, click the **Block Inserter** (+) icon and search for Page List.

![Adding a Page List Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/adding-page-list-block.gif)

Another way you can add the **Page List** block is by typing _/page list_ and hitting enter in a new paragraph block.

![Use the slash command to add a page list block](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/rONRvKkLgGdWkRTU19cfWyhCJDwRitwODnzTqW8520GycCdMorJE1KQJozOTrxzJTwXau4isohlGY4SW_pav8b22Ft5gdQkpc_htyUgyYLANwIEE3uEuYlgb7c9SKZz-m_FQu8GFCeIkZGaUo2Y-SDUqgjngN7MhdUDaKRMEzw2JmdudLo4SBoPrrM3uyQ)

Detailed instructions for adding blocks are [in this support article](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/).

Using this block on your website sidebar makes pages easily accessible to visitors. Each page name on the list links to its respective page.

Here’s how the block looks on your website sidebar:

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-list-block/\#block-toolbar)

Every block has unique toolbar icons, and block-specific user controls that let you customize the block right in the editor. The **Page List** block has the following options on its **Block Toolbar**:

- Transform to
- Drag icon
- Move handles
- More options

Note: Move and Drag option is only available if you have more than 1 block in the editor.

![Block Toolbar - Page List Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/12/block-toolbar.png)

### [Transform to](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-list-block/\#transform-to)

The **Transform to** button helps change the **Page List** block into **Columns**, **Details**, or **Group** blocks.

- **Details** – Convert the Page List into a collapsible Details block, allowing sections to be expanded or collapsed for a cleaner interface.
- **Group** – Wrap the Page List within a Group block for easier styling and layout control.
- **Columns** – Distribute the Page List items into multiple columns to optimize space usage and improve readability.

To drag and drop the block to a new location on the page, select and hold the rectangle of dots, then move it to that location. As you drag the block, the blue separator line shows where it can be dropped. When you find the desired location, release the left mouse button.
