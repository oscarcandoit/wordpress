The _Social Icons_ block allows you to add icons linking to your social media profiles or sites. This helps to increase the visibility of your social media profiles and drive traffic to them.

5. Add the URL for the social media profile in the input field and press `Enter`. If omitted, WordPress will automatically set the default protocol to `https`.

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/social-icons/\#block-toolbar)

Each block has its own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The _Social Icons_ block has two toolbars. One is the parent toolbar that appears when you select the _Social Icons_ block. The other toolbar appears when you click on the individual social icons in the block.

**The block toolbar for the Social Icons block**

The _Social Icons_ block toolbar has five buttons:

![Block toolbar in the Social Icons parent toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-17-at-8.25.56-AM.png)

**Transform to**

You can transform the _Social Icons_ block into a Group or Columns. You can also transform the style of the _Social Icons_ block. There are three styles available: **Default**, **Logos only**, and **Pill Shape**.

To drag and drop the block to a new location on the page template, click and hold the rectangle of dots, then drag to the new location. The blue separator line indicates where the block will be placed. Release the left mouse button when you find the new location to place the block.

**Move handles**

- _Justify items center_ will move the items towards the center of the block.
- _Justify items right_ will move the items towards the right side of the block.

**More options**

## [Block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/social-icons/\#block-settings)

Every block has specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar. _If you do not see the sidebar, simply click the ‘cog’ icon._

![Cog icon to display the Block sidebar](https://wordpress.org/support/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-9.39.34-AM.png)

There are two different sets of Block settings for the _Social Icons_ block.

- The settings for the whole block that appear when you select the _Social Icons_ block.
- The settings for the individual icons that appear when you click on an individual social icon.

**The block settings for the Social Icons block**

When you select the _Social Icons_ block, you will see the following settings in the sidebar.

**Layout settings**

With _Layout_ settings, you can add justification to the social icons within the _Social Icons_ block.

- left (default)
- center
- right
- space-between – will take up to 100% width and place icons at an equal distance in between

You can also change the orientation of the social icons to horizontal or stack vertically one below the other, if you have multiple social icons within the _Social Icons_ block.

_Allow to wrap to multiple lines_ toggle button lets you display the social icons in multiple lines when needed.

**Link settings**

_Open links in a new tab_: Using the toggle switch you control whether the linked profile will open in a new browser tab or not.

_Show labels_: Using this toggle switch you can choose to show or hide the labels for the social icons.

![Settings tab for Social icons block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/social-icons-settings-331x1024.png)Settings tab for Social icons block.

**Advanced settings**

The HTML Anchor is a useful tool for creating page jumps. If you toggle the block to its HTML view, you’ll see that the HTML Anchor input is added as a CSS ID to the heading tag. You can also see the CSS class in the block HTML.

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.

Based on which style you choose for the _Social Icons_ block in the _Styles_ settings, WordPress automatically adds a CSS class to the _Social Icons_ block in the **Advanced settings** panel under **Additional CSS class(es).**

![Advanced settings with the default Styles CSS classes added by WordPress based on the Styles chosen.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-17-at-11.10.54-AM-376x1024.png)

**Styles settings**

The _Styles_ settings allow you to change the style of the icons in the block. You can choose among three styles: **Default**, **Logos only**, and **Pill shape**. Hover over the _Styles_ buttons to get a preview of the styles.

![Styles settings tab for Social icons block](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1508963/246128876-8449740e-bf6b-4cd2-89aa-894ed78cafcb.jpg)

**Color settings**

Default icons have their respective brand colors. With the _Color settings_, you can change the background and foreground color for all icons in the block to match your website branding. Pick a color from the suggestions, or add a custom color using the color picker or by adding a color code.

![Color settings in the Social Icons block](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1508963/156201029-15aed9c2-651c-4022-bcc1-1e68aa4f8832.png)

**Alpha filter**

Clicking on selected color allows you to set the so-called alpha filter, which creates a certain level of color transparency.

![Alpha filter for Social icons block color settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1508963/246114359-c595a601-d461-459e-809f-dded5b1993ac.jpg)

**Background color**

Besides color settings for individual icons, it is possible to set the background color for the entire Social icons block.

[See this guide for more information about changing colors.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/)

**Dimension settings**

Dimension controls are used to control how groups of blocks are placed alongside one another, by changing the values for padding, margin, and other dimensions

![Setting the block spacing for the top and bottom](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-17-at-11.19.50-AM.png)

[Learn more about dimension controls.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/dimension-controls-overview/)

**The block settings for individual social icons**

When you click on the individual social icons in the _Social Icons_ block, you get a different set of **Block settings** in the sidebar.

**Link label**

In the Social Icon sidebar settings, you can add a Link label. The label helps screen reader users understand the context of the link.

**Advanced**

**Link rel**

A new customizable “rel” attribute for the Social Icons block addresses the need to claim ownership of your WordPress sites on social networks.

To achieve this, these social networks require users to set a link back to their URL with the `rel="me"` attribute. With this new setting it is possible to configure the “rel” attribute for each social icon displayed on your WordPress site.

**Additional CSS classes**

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
