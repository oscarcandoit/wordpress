Blocks are the components for adding content in the new [WordPress block editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/). There are several blocks available within WordPress that you can easily [add](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/) to your post or page, [move](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/moving-blocks/) within a post or page and [search for](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/#searching-for-blocks).

There are different ways to configure and [work with these blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/working-with-blocks/). You can also install additional third party blocks from the [WordPress block directory](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-directory/).

Below is a list of the blocks that are currently available within WordPress. We will be adding to this list as more blocks are added with each release.

The Block Inserter categorizes the blocks into 6 different types: Text, Media, Design, Widgets, Theme and Embeds.
