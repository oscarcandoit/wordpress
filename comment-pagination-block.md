[Go to the List of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The _Comments Pagination_ block is part of the Comments block that displays paginated navigation to the previous or next comment sections.

By default, a _Comments Pagination_ block is included when you insert a Comments block. However, you can still add this block manually.

![Comment Pagination block inside Comment Query loop block](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sTzynovJCxljQDiQxMsz3XHMdoIeL4Mrg-kdgzbdYd5lzk3saa8nSuxGZDVEyjN9IcnVNFOyFKmIAjL5DrsyaISfr__-syuTUITuTJwZKKkMqpsa3Xn9V6LlJUYt1LbY7otKQpm9BERsuAwik9ZuGXE)

You can only insert the _Comments Pagination block_ inside a Comments block.

To add the block, select the Comments block and hover your mouse over a blank space. Click the (+) icon to open the block inserter pop-up window. Look for the _Comments Pagination_ block using the search bar and click on the block icon to add it to the Comments block.

Alternatively, add a Paragraph block within the Comments block and type /comments-pagination to insert the _Comments Pagination_ block.
