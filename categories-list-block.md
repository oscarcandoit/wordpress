### [Categories List settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/categories-list-block/\#categories-list-settings)

The Categories List settings allow you to choose whether to display the categories list as a dropdown, or the default bulleted list. You also have the choice to show/hide the hierarchy, the top-level categories only, and the post counts.

**Display as dropdown**

Choose this option to display the categories in a dropdown menu rather than as a list. This is handy if you want to save space or have a lot of categories.

[![Categories displayed as dropdown](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-04-at-4.05.10-PM.png)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-04-at-4.05.10-PM.png) Categories displayed as dropdown

**Show post counts**

If this option is chosen, the total number of published posts for each category will be displayed next to the category link. You can show post counts in both the list and dropdown display formats.

![Categories with post counts shown](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/171647939-ebeb8c27-7976-4c57-a037-cf7e45b633cd-1024x235.png)Categories list block with post counts shown

**Show only top-level categories**

If you have parent and child categories (subcategories within main categories) you can choose to display only the top-level category.

**Show empty categories**

You have the option to show or hide empty categories in the categories list.

**Show hierarchy**

If you have parent and child categories (subcategories within main categories) you can choose to display the hierarchy or just leave the list without indicating which subcategories fit inside your main categories. You can show category hierarchies in both the list and dropdown display formats.
