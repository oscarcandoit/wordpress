[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The _SmugMug Embed block_ helps to embed images from SmugMug.com on your page or blog post. All you need to embed a SmugMug image is a SmugMug image URL. You do not need a SmugMug account to embed images.

**Steps To Embed SmugMug Images on your Page or Post**

**1\. Choose an Image from smugmug.com and find image URL**

Search for an image from smugmug.com and select any image to embed on a page or post.

After choosing an image we want on our page or post, copy its URL from the address bar of our browser.

**2\. Copy the image URL**

5\. **Click the “Embed” button**

A preview won’t be displayed.

![Embed content for this block cannot be previewed in the editor ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/08/block-3.png)

If we use an URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message _“Sorry, this content could not be embedded.”_

You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or convert it to a link.

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/smugmug-embed/\#block-toolbar)

![Block Toolbar with options available for the SmugMug Block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/08/tool.png)

Besides the Mover and Drag & Drop Handle, the Block Toolbar for the _SmugMug Embed block_ shows four buttons:

- Transform to
- Change alignment
- Edit URL, and
- More Options.

**Transform to**:

![Options to transform the SmugMug block to Paragraph, or Group.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/08/transform-.png)

You can transform a _SmugMug Embed block_ to a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the SmugMug embed.

**Alignment:**

- **Align left** – Make the SmugMug post left aligned
- **Align center** – Make the SmugMug post alignment centered
- **Align right**– Make the  SmugMug post align right
- **Wide width** – Increase the width of the post beyond the content size
- **Full width** – extend the SmugMug post to cover the full width of the screen.

“Wide width” and “Full width” alignment need to be enabled by the Theme of your site.

**Edit URL**

Via the edit URL, you can change the SmugMug URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the “Embed” Button

![Editing the block URL via the "edit" option.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/08/edi.png)

**More Options:**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/smugmug-embed/\#block-settings)

Besides the Advanced section, the SmugMug embed has only one setting in the “Block Settings” sidebar: Media Settings.

![Media settings for the embed block with the toggle OFF/ON for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/block2.png)

Via the Media Settings you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
