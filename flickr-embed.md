[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

With the Flickr embed block, you can add photos and videos from Flickr to your posts and pages. However, when you click any photo or video, it will take you to Flickr where you can see photos and play videos.

You can also embed photo albums and galleries with the next/previous arrow links. You don’t need a Flickr account to embed photos or videos.

Note: With video, the page/post only displays the image of the video. There will be no play/pause button. By clicking on the video, it will be redirected to the corresponding Flickr page to play.

You can only share those photos and videos which are visible to everyone(public). Some publishers put restrictions by setting privacy.

**Steps to embed Flickr photos or videos to your post or page**

1. Find your photo or video on Flickr.com, and copy the URL of the photo, album, gallery or video from the browser bar.

4. Click the “Embed” button

If the link can be successfully embedded into the post/page, you will see the preview in your block editor.

If you use a URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message “Sorry, this content could not be embedded.” You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or convert to link.

**Group**

You can transform a Flickr embed into a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the Flickr embed.

**Change Alignment**

![Changing alignment for the Flickr embed block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-28-at-2.58.55-PM.png)

- **Align left** – Make the Flickr post left aligned
- **Align center** – Make the Flickr post alignment centered
- **Align right**– Make the  Flickr post-align-right
- **Wide width** – Increase the width of the post beyond the content size
- **Full width** – extend the Flickr post to cover the full width of the screen.

**Note:** “Wide width” and “Full width” alignment needs to be enabled by the Theme of your site.

**Edit URL**

Via the edit URL, you can change the Flickr Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the “Embed” Button.

![Edit the URL for the Flickr embed block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/08/Edit-Post-WP5.5r8.3.png)

**More Options**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/flickr-embed/\#block-settings)

### [Media settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/flickr-embed/\#media-settings)

![Media settings for the Flickr embed block - set to Resize for smaller devices ON.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-28-at-3.08.53-PM.png)

Via the Media Settings, you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

“Off:” This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position, the toggle switch is gray.

“On:” This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
