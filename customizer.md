[WordPress Version 3.4](https://wordpress.org/documentation/wordpress-version/version-3-4/) introduced Theme Customizer, which allows you to play around with various looks and settings for your current theme or one you’re thinking about switching to without publishing those changes to the whole world. For themes that support it, you can change colors, backgrounds, custom image headers, and so on.

If you select Appearance -> Customize menu from the [Administration Screens](https://wordpress.org/support/article/administration-screens), Theme Customizer is launched. The Customizer allows you to preview changes to your site before publishing them. If you directly modify theme files and they are updated, then your modifications may be lost. By using Customizer you will ensure that your modifications are preserved.

**Important Note**:

The Customizer is only available if the active theme supports a Customize ability. For [Block themes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/) that support building your site with blocks, this means you will not need to use the Customizer causing it to be hidden except if you are using a plugin that requires it. In addition, this screen will likely be different for each Theme that enables and builds it. The Customizer for [WordPress Twenty Twenty-One theme](https://wordpress.org/support/article/twenty-twenty-one/), for example, provides options to change the background colors, select a background image and turn on the Dark Mode.
