Getting involved in testing WordPress means you will be directly involved in raising the quality of the WordPress user experience.

There are many different types of testing including, but not limited to, [beta testing](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta/), [user testing](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/user-testing/), and [automated testing](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/).

If you are looking for a place to get started, the first thing you will want to do is set up a test site. Once you have that going, you will be able to participate in beta testing or walkthrough feature projects and then test those features with others.
