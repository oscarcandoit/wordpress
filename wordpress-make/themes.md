### Welcome to the Themes team!

We are a group of volunteers who review and approve themes submitted to be included in the official WordPress Theme directory.

We do license, security, and code quality reviews.

We help build and maintain default themes.

The primary focus of the team is to help theme authors transition to block-based themes.

If this sounds interesting, read more [about the team here](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/about/). Check out our [guide for new reviewers](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/onboarding-for-new-reviewers/) and the [frequently asked questions](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/faq/).

#### Handbooks and review requirements

The team maintains the official [Theme Review Requirements](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/), the [Theme Unit Test Data](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test), and helps the documentation team with the [Theme Developer Handbook.](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/)

#### Coding standards and plugins

We maintain the [WPThemeReview Standard for PHP\_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/WPTT/WPThemeReview), the [Theme Sniffer plugin](https://github.com/WPTT/theme-sniffer) and [Theme Check](https://github.com/WordPress/theme-check)

#### Code Packages

We have code packages for themes available for use on [GitHub](https://github.com/WPTT/) and [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/wptrt/)

#### Communication

Meet us in the [#themes](https://app.slack.com/client/T024MFP4J/C02RP4Y3K) Slack channel.

### 3\. Open Floor

During the open floor, [@greenshady](https://profiles.wordpress.org/greenshady/) shared that, he is hoping to return to the [Theme Handbook overhaul project](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/816) soon. Which is one of the good news.

During the meeting, he said, “There’s a lot of old classic theme docs that need to be overhauled or moved. Would the team be OK with just moving the old docs to the Classic Themes chapter at first? Then, can we more slowly iterate and update over time? Doing a big overhaul of all the old docs at once doesn’t seem to be the best route.”

He added, Just for context on the above doc question, there are a lot of questions from themers/users on why there are multiple top-level pages with similar information. So I think this would help lower confusion as we work through the docs. But if we have thumbs up, I’ll go ahead and start planning this for the coming weeks. [@kafleg](https://profiles.wordpress.org/kafleg/) is also interested in helping if needed.

[@bijayyadav](https://profiles.wordpress.org/bijayyadav/) agreed and said, “Yes, good to have moved the old docs to the Classic Themes chapter at first and slowly update over time”.

Another attendee, [@rollybueno](https://profiles.wordpress.org/rollybueno/), asked the question about inactivity duration in the trac.

As there were small groups of attendees and no more agendas to discuss in the meeting, [@bijayyadav](https://profiles.wordpress.org/bijayyadav/) closed the meeting.
