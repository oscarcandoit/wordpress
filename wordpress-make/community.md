It is with deep regret that WordPress Community Support must share the news that surplus funds from a 2024 WordCamp were used by an organizer for personal expenses. Despite several attempts to recover these funds, it is now clear that the organizer does not intend to return the money, and the program considers it lost. The total amount taken was approximately $734.

The surplus occurred in a locale where the team managed the money locally, versus through WPCS. To help prevent this from happening again, WPCS will now send Global Sponsorship Grants in several smaller payments. This change in our policy will be effective as of today, September 30, 2025, and will apply to all events managing funds locally.

To expand on the process further, the first payment under the Global Sponsorship Grant program will cover initial event deposits. As the event date approaches and the number of attendees becomes more clear, the remainder of the funds needed can be requested. This process should reduce the occurence of extra money being left over after an event concludes that must then be returned to WPCS.

The following actions are being taken against the individual responsible for the misappropriation:

- A legal report will be filed with the local authority responsible for monitoring ethics and corruption.
- The individual is banned for life from organizing or attending any WordPress events.
- Their .org account is permanently banned, which also removes their access to the Make WordPress Slack.

These measures may seem severe, but the organizer was given multiple chances to communicate and set up a repayment plan. Unfortunately, no effort was made to resolve the issue.

The WordPress events program is built on trust. Organizers are trusted from the beginning, as representatives of WordPress in their communities and as caretakers of event funds. Even when faced with challenges, our aim is to support each other and work from a place of trust.

> To help prevent this from happening again, WPCS will now send Global Sponsorship Grants in several smaller payments.

This happened one time. Please don‚Äôt punish all organizers for one bad actor. Trust, and verify. But default to trust.

Completely agree with this statement. Given this individual is no longer involved in the community this year, the incident did not affect planning for the 2025 event.

The idea would be to send an initial lump sum grant payment to cover deposits with vendors; whatever amount is needed to keep planning on track. In many cases, attendance numbers will fluctuate, leading to changes in total amounts needed for catering, swag, etc. By sending the 2nd portion of a global grant once attendee counts are more accurate, hopefully cases of large surpluses or deficits will be avoided. Returning funds can be complicated in some locales, as well, so there would be less responsibility on a team to manage that post event.

I think it‚Äôs worth noting that this change was not specifically as a direct result of this situation, but does help with preventing future incidents of it, and should not be considered ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù.

Additionally, if an initial lump sum was ever not enough to cover the deposits, or the event was suffering financial hardship as a result of it, a short discussion with WPCS would normally resolve this through either a direct payment to the vendor, an additional payment to the local entity, or larger grant applied as needed (If sponsorship funds or ticket sales were not expected to cover it, as initially thought).

This also only affects events where funds are run through a non-WPCS entity, and for example, in Australia where we use this, the entity we run through can offer the local organisers a ‚Äúfloat‚Äù of funds to cover future income not yet received, as part of the agreement of them taking shared financial risk.

### An Agreement that Opens New Paths

At the Faculty of Computer Science of Universidad Fid√©litas, we have taken a historic step: we signed an agreement with the WordPress Foundation, turning our Computer Science students into key players in a global experience. Thanks to this partnership, every student will have the opportunity to complete an official internship through [WP Credits](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/), directly connecting with the WordPress community and its impact-driven projects.

This agreement reflects a deep conviction: higher education must be tied to the real digital ecosystem, with experiences that prepare students for jobs and to become agents of change within global tech communities.

### The Birth of the WordPress Campus Connect San Jos√© 2025

To celebrate this alliance, we organized the first WordPress Campus Connect in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, from September 23 to 25, 2025.

This event marked a milestone as the first WordPress Campus Connect held in Latin America within a university, open to participation from any individual who was a university student, regardless of their field of study or academic level, and carried out in a three-day hackathon format. Throughout the event, participants engaged in hands-on workshops, received direct mentorship, and took part in the WordPress HackLab, a competition designed to transform ideas into digital products with real societal impact.

### The Workshops: Learning with Energy and Creativity

The heart of Campus Connect lies in the eight workshops that guided students step by step in building their projects:

1. **From Zero to Website in 90 Minutes** ‚Äì How to quickly start and launch a functional site.
2. **Your Digital Empire, Brick by Brick** ‚Äì Strategic construction of a solid, scalable website.
3. **Think Like a Rebel: Create Without Asking Permission** ‚Äì Fearless innovation, exploring creative freedom with design thinking.
4. **Let‚Äôs Dress Up: Branding that Hypnotizes** ‚Äì Keys to visual identity and branding to stand out online.
5. **Secret Vitamins for Your Website: What WordPress Doesn‚Äôt Tell You** ‚Äì Advanced tips and features to power up any site.
6. **So Engaging They‚Äôll Read with Eyes Closed** ‚Äì Strategies for clear, persuasive, and AI-enhanced content.
7. **Houston, We Have a Website! (Go Live)** ‚Äì How to move a project from testing to production.
8. **Your Story on Fire (and in 3 Acts)** ‚Äì Digital storytelling and impactful project presentations.

These workshops were not only technical but also creative and strategic, showing students that WordPress is a living, open, and limitless ecosystem.

### The Challenge: ‚ÄúReconnecting the Human‚Äù

The central competition of the event was the WPCC 2025 Challenge: _Reconnecting the Human_.

The challenge stemmed from a paradox: we have never been so digitally connected, yet we have never felt so lonely. In response, teams had to create a digital product, presented in WordPress, that strengthens in-person human relationships within the university or local community.

The proposals were aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 3, 10, and 11) and ESG principles. Within this framework:

- **SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being)** encouraged initiatives to strengthen emotional health and reduce loneliness.
- **SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)** inspired inclusive and accessible solutions for the entire community.
- **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)** motivated proposals to rescue traditions and foster coexistence in public spaces.

At the same time, ESG principles framed the action plan: environmental care, positive social impact, and ethical, participatory governance. WordPress became the showcase to tell the story of the problem, the value proposition, the digital product, and the expected impact.

### The Organizing Team: The Force Behind the Event

None of this would have been possible without the dedication of a passionate organizing team that brought this first WordPress Campus Connect to life:

- **[@ritaroblesloaiza](https://wordpress.slack.com/team/U038G3F202Y)**‚Äì Lead Organizer

### WordPress Club Fid√©litas and Its Podcast

Another historic milestone was the official founding of the **WordPress Club Fid√©litas**, a permanent space where students, faculty, and the community can come together to learn, share, and contribute to the WordPress ecosystem.

As part of this initiative, the Club‚Äôs podcast was launched, where we will talk about:

- WordPress and its impact on the global web.
- Technological innovation applied to education.
- Academic and community experiences from Fid√©litas.

This podcast will serve as a bridge between academia and the international WordPress community, amplifying the voices of our students and their projects.

You can listen to the podcast here: [WordPress Club Fid√©litas on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6swxhK8dLDCECXsvZvhAYs?si=5d8521e94bb44ff8)

### A Starting Point, Not the Destination

The WordPress Campus Connect San Jos√© and the agreement with the WordPress Foundation are just the beginning.

Every student who participates in this program will take with them not only technical WordPress skills but also the experience of belonging to a global community, working with purpose, and using technology to generate human impact.

### Inspiring Transformation

With this event, we proved that a university can be innovative, close, and global at the same time.

The invitation is clear: to keep dreaming, creating, and reconnecting the human through technology. Because when academia and community walk together, the impossible becomes reality.

Hello [@krupajnanda](https://profiles.wordpress.org/krupajnanda/)! The program has already started at two universities: the University of Pisa (Italy) and Fid√©litas University (Costa Rica). We are currently in talks with other institutions in different countries to offer this program to their students as well. Our goal is to assign mentors from the same countries as the students to help them build both local and global connections within the WordPress community. Although the program has not yet launched in many countries, we want to collect interest from potential mentors so that once we are ready to start the program in their regions, we already know who to reach out to. We will keep everyone updated on new university partnerships so they can follow along. Please let me know if you have any other questions, and laso feel free to join us in the [#wpcredits](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C0959D2M3T8) Slack channel.

This is a fantastic initiative üëè

I‚Äôd like to ask a related question: can students officially complete their internships through the WordPress Credits program?

Depends on the region, but students can participate and finish an internship through WPCredits.

While we are seeking mentors for implementing the training, are we also looking at finding volunteers to go to universities and colleges to introduce WordPress and the program.
