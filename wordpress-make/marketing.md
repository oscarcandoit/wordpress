Thanks to [@bjmcsherry](https://profiles.wordpress.org/bjmcsherry/), [@dd32](https://profiles.wordpress.org/dd32/), and [@ryelle](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ryelle/), all of our [active social platforms](https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/handbook/social-media/) are now represented in the footer of WordPress.org: [X](https://twitter.com/WordPress/), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/wordpress.org), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.world/@WordPress), [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@wordpress), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WordPress/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wordpress/), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wordpress/), [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@wordpress), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/wordpress), and [Tumblr](https://wordpress.tumblr.com/). Since switching to [Postpone](https://www.postpone.app/) as our new scheduling tool last month, we’ve been able to reliably schedule and share content with our audience of 2.4 million followers across all of these platforms.

[Expand / Include all of the WordPress social media accounts #689](https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-mu-plugins/pull/689)

While we do optimize post times and content for each platform, you can expect similar updates across platforms (I.e. no worries about missing out if you’re only on Bluesky or Mastodon). As a reminder, requests to amplify WordPress project content across social media can be [made in Github using the “Request for Amplification” issue template](https://github.com/WordPress/Marketing-Team/issues).

Thanks. It’s great to have an easyJet overview to find these platforms

The automated [WordPress.tv to YouTube sync](http://wordpress.tv/) has been restored. This semi-automated process brings videos posted to WordPress.tv, primarily recordings from WordCamps and other WordPress events, over to the [official WordPress YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@WordPress).

This sync was paused in October 2024 to allow for a reevaluation of the video pipeline and content strategy. However, Q1 metrics show a 38% decline in YouTube subscriber growth compared to Q1 2024, along with a noticeable dip in average watch time. These trends highlight the importance of continuing to bring community-generated content to the platform—including WordCamp sessions.

WordPress’s official YouTube channel recently surpassed 110,000 subscribers, underscoring its reach as a hub for education, inspiration, and connection. Reinstating the WPTV sync will ensure that videos from WordCamps around the world continue to be shared and viewed widely, supporting the project’s goal of representing the global WordPress community.

If YouTube isn’t your preferred platform, WordPress is also represented on [X](https://twitter.com/WordPress/), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/wordpress.org), [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@wordpress), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.world/@WordPress), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WordPress/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wordpress/), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wordpress/), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/wordpressevents), [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@wordpress), and [Tumblr](https://wordpress.tumblr.com/).

Sorry for just discovering this post. Could you elaborate on what semi-automated means here? What or who determines which videos sync from WPTV to YouTube?

The process is documented in this marketing handbook: [WPTV to YT Publication Process](https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/handbook/social-media/wptv-to-yt-publication-process/).

> What or who determines which videos sync from WPTV to YouTube?

Excluding any errors, all WPTV videos are uploaded to YouTube.

Thanks for that context!

I discussed this with [@eidolonnight](https://profiles.wordpress.org/eidolonnight/) in Slack and wanted to summarize publicly.

I came across this post because I was curious of the reason why a few of my talks were not on YouTube despite being on WordPress.tv already for some time. In this case, I was looking to embed a talk from WordCamp Asia 2025 and I noticed that WCUS 2024 and WCEU 2025 were also missing. I noticed that the [WCEU 2025 playlist only contained 6 videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSD6yvp-UHE&list=PL1pJFUVKQ7ES9az66FJ6pFJsgArif7gGC), which were the live streams and the two keynotes.

What we discussed is that there are likely several factors at play, one being that the process for flagship events was seeing a high failure rate with the video files being so large.

I checked today before commenting, and it seems that a large number of these missing talks have been uploaded to YouTube successfully. I’ll let [@eidolonnight](https://profiles.wordpress.org/eidolonnight/) speak to what happened there and whether anything has changed to increase success of this process going forward.
