The hosting team works to improve WordPress‚Äô end-user experience across hosting environments through industry collaboration and user education.

Want to contribute? Come join us!

- The team meets in the [#hosting](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/hosting) Slack channel each week on Wednesday at 0900 UTC and 1800 UTC. Check out local times at [make/meetings](https://make.wordpress.org/meetings/#hosting).
- [Contribute automated test results](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/test-results/) from your hosting environment, and help build the [test runner](https://github.com/wordpress/phpunit-test-runner/issues) and [results page](https://github.com/wordpress/phpunit-test-reporter/issues)!
- See more details about ongoing projects on the [Team Projects page](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/team-projects/).

Learn more about hosting WordPress in [the handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/). Feel free to bring up recommendations for changes and additions [in Slack](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/hosting)!

Web hosting plays a critical role in how people experience WordPress. Everything from performance and stability to security and upgrades is shaped by a site‚Äôs host. Many hosts also customize the WordPress experience with their own onboarding, features, and default settings.

As the web evolves, hosting continues to shape the way people use WordPress. The 2025 Hosting Survey is an opportunity for providers to share their WordPress setup and practices in a collaborative and transparent way.

The last survey [was run in 2023](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/2023/07/26/wordpress-hosting-survey/). Starting this year, it will be conducted annually to provide an up-to-date picture of the state of WordPress hosting and how it is changing over time.

The survey asks about a range of topics, including:

- Company background (size, founding year)
- Technology stack (PHP and database versions, caching, performance tools)
- Security practices (backups, vulnerability scanning, incident response)
- WordPress experience (installer defaults, upgrades, onboarding, bundled plugins)
- Support and reliability (support channels, response times, SLAs, uptime guarantees)
- Ecommerce and advanced features (staging environments, payment integrations, customizations)

**New this year:** the results will be published in a full report, which will include the raw survey data, trends, and insights. Responses also inform updates to WordPress.org hosting recommendations, helping ensure they reflect the current state of the ecosystem.

We invite all WordPress hosting providers, large and small, to participate. The more hosts that take part, the more complete and representative the report will be. This is a chance for the hosting community to work together toward a clearer understanding of how WordPress is being used today.

If you prefer, you can also submit a spreadsheet instead; please [make a copy of the survey template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NrGdAEsbqiYTQ6uTuIQ---NQAj-6EMvcEbuiIadFsVo/edit?gid=594886467#gid=594886467), and once your responses have been recorded, export and [upload your submission](https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/wordpress-hosting-survey-2025-file-upload).

The survey will remain open until **October 15, 2025**.

This post kicks off the election process with nominations to replace the current Hosting Team Reps.

Current Team Reps are [@zunaid321](https://profiles.wordpress.org/zunaid321/) and [@crixu](https://profiles.wordpress.org/crixu/).

## The Role

In the WordPress open-source project, each team has on average one or two representatives, abbreviated as Reps. The Team Rep represents the team to the wider Make project, and the project to the Hosting Team.

We need multiple (2-4) Team Reps to cover each other and make sure the team is not led by a single individual. This allows responsibilities to be shared, ensures continuity, and helps provide coverage across different time zones. We welcome anyone who contributes to the team by preparing and running meetings, running a contributor day table, or contributing to our projects ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to be a rep for that.

It‚Äôs not called ‚Äúteam lead‚Äù for a reason. It‚Äôs an **administrative role**. While people elected as team reps will generally come from the pool of folks that people think of as experienced leaders, the Team Rep role is designed to change hands regularly. As a Team Rep, you‚Äôre accountable to ‚Äúget things done‚Äù within the team and aggregate ideas into doable actions.

This role has a time commitment attached to it. Not a huge amount, it‚Äôs at least three hours a week. Here are the main tasks:

- Post the agenda, host the chats, and summarize them.
- Keeping an eye on the moving parts of the team to be able to report for quarterly updates.

Full¬†[details on the Team Rep role is on the Team Update site](https://make.wordpress.org/updates/team-reps/).

## How the election works

This post is the **Call for Nominations**. Please add your nominations in the comments of this post or submit them through [this survey.](https://crixu4491.survey.fm/hosting-team-rep-survey-2026) Self-nominations are welcome. If you prefer to nominate someone in private, you can also reach out to one of the current Team Reps directly on Slack ( [@zunaid321](https://profiles.wordpress.org/zunaid321/) and [@crixu](https://profiles.wordpress.org/crixu/)).

The nomination period will run until **October 28th, 2025 at 23:59 UTC**. Nominations will then be published on **October 29th**, and nominees will have until **November 4th** to confirm whether they are willing to be on the polls.

The **Voting Period** will run from **November 5th to November 25th**, and the results will be announced by **December 3rd**. The new reps will officially start their role in **January 2026**.

**Disclaimer:** If you get nominated, please don‚Äôt feel like you have to say yes. The polls will only include the names of the people who respond positively to a nomination. So feel free to reply with a ‚ÄúThank you, but no, thank you.‚Äù

If you require supplemental information, please feel free to ask in the comments ‚Äî we will be happy to reply. Please also include your opinion on the ‚Äútwo vs. four team reps‚Äù proposal.
