**Welcome to the WordPress Support Handbook.**

The WordPress Support Handbook is the number one destination for tips, tricks, and advice to assist you in giving the best WordPress support possible.

This handbook is a guide put together by the community and represents over ten years of WordPress support experience. Please feel free to start with the selections to the left, and we hope you enjoy making use of this as much as we enjoyed writing it!

**Need help with a WordPress issue?**
