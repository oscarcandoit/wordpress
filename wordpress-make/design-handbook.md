The design of WordPress and WordPress.org are constantly evolving. This handbook documents the base design concepts to be used throughout the WordPress ecosystem, as well as more specific design treatments.

## [Foundations](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/\#foundations)

In the Foundations section, the WordPress [Identity](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/foundations/identity/), [Colors](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/foundations/colors/), [Typography](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/foundations/typography/), and [Iconography](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/foundations/iconography/) are outlined. These foundational elements are to be used throughout the WordPress ecosystem, including WordPress core, WordPress.org, related websites, and even print materials.

## [Core](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/\#core)

The Core section of this handbook will document specific core treatments.

## [WordPress.org](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/\#wordpress-org-2)

The WordPress.org section of this handbook will document specific treatments for WordPress.org including the [typography](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/wordpress-org/typography/) used, [metrics](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/wordpress-org/metrics/) (like the grid), and the overall [navigational structure](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/wordpress-org/navigation/) (information architecture).

## [Peripherals](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/\#peripherals)

There are a number of other parts of the WordPress ecosystem that will receive their own treatment. Currently, we plan to outline the design treatments for the [WordPress Foundation](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/peripherals/wordpress-foundation/), [WordPress.tv](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/peripherals/wordpress-tv/), [WordCamp.org](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/peripherals/wordcamp-org/), [bbPress](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/peripherals/bbpress/), and [BuddyPress](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/peripherals/buddypress/).
