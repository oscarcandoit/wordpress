## Welcome!

The WordPress core development team builds WordPress! Follow this site for¬†general updates, status reports, and the occasional code debate. There‚Äôs lots of ways to contribute:

- **Found a bug?** [Create a ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/bb-login.php?redirect_to=https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket) in the bug tracker.
- **Want to contribute?** Get started quickly with tickets marked as [good first bugs](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/good-first-bugs) for new contributors or join a [bug scrub](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/bug-gardening/). There‚Äôs more on the [reports page](https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/), like [patches needing testing](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/needs-testing), and on [feature projects page](https://make.wordpress.org/core/features/).
- **Other questions?** Here is a detailed [handbook for contributors](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/), complete with tutorials.

## Communication

Core uses [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/)¬†for real-time communication. Contributors live all over the world, so there are discussions happening at all hours of the day.

Core development meetings are every Wednesday at [15:00 UTC](https://time.is/1500_in_UTC) in the [**#core**](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core/) channel on [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/). Anyone can join and participate or listen in!

It‚Äôs time to get [WordPress 6.9 ready for release](https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-8/https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-9/), and help is needed to ensure it‚Äôs smooth and bug-free. Whether you‚Äôre an experienced contributor or joining in for the first time, everyone is welcome! üéâ

Schedule Overview

Regular bug scrubs are being held twice a week with [@wildworks](https://profiles.wordpress.org/wildworks/) and [@welcher](https://profiles.wordpress.org/welcher/) leading them in their individual timezones. The goal is to cover as many timezones as possible to encourage as many contributors as possible to participate in the 6.9 release. As the release date approaches and activity ramps up, the number of scrubs may be increased if necessary. These efforts will help ensure everything is on track for a smooth launch. Participation is welcome at any of these sessions, so feel free to join. Bring questions, ideas, and let‚Äôs scrub some bugs together!

[@welcher](https://profiles.wordpress.org/welcher/) a little outdated this section:

**‚ÄúWhat about recurring component scrubs and triage sessions?‚Äù**

**Where did you got it from?**

‚úÖAccessibility Scrub: Every Tuesday, 15:00 UTC, in the [#accessibility](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/accessibility/) channel.

‚ùå (not happening more) Design Scrub: Every Tuesday, 16:00 UTC, in the [#design](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/design/) channel.

‚ùå (not happening more) Editor Scrub: Every Tuesday, 14:00 UTC, in the #core-editor channel.

üîÑ(changed to Thursdays, 15:00 UTC) Testing Scrub: Every Friday, 13:15 UTC, in the [#core-test](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core-test/) channel.

‚ùìPerformance Scrub: Every other Wednesday, 15:00 UTC, in the [#core-performance](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core-performance/) channel. (I‚Äôm not sure about this because it stopped for a couple of months, but all of sudden, today, a Tuesday, [@westonruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) ran a scrub at 15:00 UTC, not sure if he is going to keep this up, or if it was spontaneous.)

‚úÖ Test Team Triage: Each second Wednesday at 16:00 UTC in the [#core-test](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core-test/) channel.

Also, want to comment to [@wildworks](https://profiles.wordpress.org/wildworks/) and you that I‚Äôm running every Thursday at 14:00 UTC in [#core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core/) a regular bug-scrub for the Post/Post-Types component specifically. After Beta 1, I will start giving priority to 6.9 tickets in this specific component.

[@sirlouen](https://profiles.wordpress.org/sirlouen/) we are supposed to have a performance bug scrub every second week, in the weeks alternating our biweekly office hours. We haven‚Äôt had the bug scrubs regularly, but this has just been due to availability issues. We should be able to do them regularly going forward. So the next one would be on September 30th at the same time.

Ok, so it looks that session moved from Wednesdays at 15:00 UTC to Tuesdays at the same time.

[@sirlouen](https://profiles.wordpress.org/sirlouen/) thank you for calling that out! This was my mistake, I duplicated an older post as the starting point for this one and then promptly forgot to double check the meeting times.

I have updated the meetings times to reflect the changes you indicated and removed the Testing Team Triage until they have defined their schedule.

My apologies for any confusion!

please add this critical bug related to sitemap in wordpress 6.8.3 or 6.9

We need a new feature as this is very difficult to do and that is rename the HOME page to anything we want and lock it so no Plugin or Theme can change it without permission. I figured out how to rename my HOME Menu and when I installed a Theme it created a new menu and renamed (New Name) back to HOME. Can we have this fixed please and update WordPress so we can easily change the home name. One thing that‚Äôs is seriously wrong in WordPress and that‚Äôs the Menu System. New rules need to be made and settings. I can‚Äôt believe no one has figured out yet what needs to be done. Some one please fix the Menu System in WordPress and why hasn‚Äôt anyone figured out it doesn‚Äôt work efficiently.

## Discussion üí¨

### A number of issues require some final review

Multiple people brought up issues that are close to being complete but could use some help getting over the finish line.

- [@westonruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/)¬†highlighted¬†[https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/8412](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/8412)¬†(Output Buffering)



This is expected to be merged very shortly and there is a [fast-follow ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/64099) for leveraging this to improve the LCP metric for classic themes.
- [@luminuu](https://profiles.wordpress.org/luminuu/) highlighted¬†[https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/71703](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/71703)¬†(Fix selection of font size presets if presets have the same¬†`size`¬†value)
- [@dmsnell](https://profiles.wordpress.org/dmsnell/) highlighted¬†[https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/9105](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/9105)¬†(Introduce¬†`WP_Block_Processor`¬†for efficiently parsing blocks)
- [@dmsnell](https://profiles.wordpress.org/dmsnell/) highlighted¬†[https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/10011](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/10011)¬†(Polyfill¬†`utf8_encode()`¬†and¬†`utf8_decode()`¬†)



This could really use some additional input from anyone with time to help.
- [@cr0ybot](https://profiles.wordpress.org/cr0ybot/) highlighted¬†[https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/49094](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/49094)¬†(Term Query Block)



The two specific pieces that could use some help here are:

  - Feature enhancement, selected terms:¬†[https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72286](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72286)
  - Update inherit control:¬†[https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72313](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72313)

### Merging the Abilities API

[@gziolo](https://profiles.wordpress.org/gziolo/) is working merge the [Abilities API](https://make.wordpress.org/ai/2025/07/17/abilities-api/) into core for WordPress 6.9. There is [new version of the Composer package](https://packagist.org/packages/wordpress/abilities-api#v0.3.0-rc.) for wider testing and a [PR to core](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/9410) that is ready for review.

The [Feature Plugin Merge Criteria](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/features-as-plugins/#feature-plugin-merge-criteria) were reviewed and as this was never published as a plugin (only a composer package), it‚Äôs not necessary to deactivate it when it is merged into core.

Everyone is invited to review the [documentation describing the API](https://github.com/WordPress/abilities-api/tree/trunk/docs) and the [Pull Request](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/9410) to ensure this code is ready to be shipped in beta 1. Follow [https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/64098](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/64098) for more information.

Props to [@francina](https://profiles.wordpress.org/francina/) for pre-publication review

[#6-9](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/6-9/), [#core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core/), [#dev-chat](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-chat/)

The next WordPress Developers Chat will take place on [Wednesday, October 15, 2025 at 11:00 AM EDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20251015T1500) in the¬†[core](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core/)¬†channel on¬†[Make WordPress Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/).

The live meeting will focus on the discussion for upcoming releases, and have an open floor section.

The various curated agenda sections below refer to additional items. If you have¬†ticket¬†requests for help, please continue to post details in the comments section at the end of this agenda or bring them up during the dev chat.

## Forthcoming releases üöÄ

### **WordPress 6.9 Timeline**

WordPress 6.9 is planned for **December 2, 2025**, with Beta 1 beginning **October 21**. Join one of the [release parties](https://make.wordpress.org/core/) to make WordPress.

### Bug Scrub Schedule

Regular scrubs are already underway, led by [@wildworks](https://profiles.wordpress.org/wildworks/) and [@welcher](https://profiles.wordpress.org/welcher/) across time zones.

Full details are in the [Bug Scrub Schedule for WordPress 6.9](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/09/15/bug-scrub-schedule-for-wordpress-6-9/).

## Discussions üí¨

_The discussion section of the agenda is for discussing important topics affecting the upcoming release or larger initiatives that impact the Core Team. To nominate a topic for discussion, please leave a comment on this agenda with a summary of the topic, any relevant links that will help people get context for the discussion, and what kind of feedback you are looking for from others participating in the discussion._

[@luminuu](https://profiles.wordpress.org/luminuu/) asked for a final review of [https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/71703](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/71703). There‚Äôs one issue with some failing tests, but while the tests indicate that something isn‚Äôt imported, it is actually present in the file. If anyone has any idea, I‚Äôd appreciate the feedback. Jessica made all the requested code changes and would like to get the ticket in for 6.9, as it resolves a poor user experience for anyone trying to use font size presets, especially when using fluid custom values.

[@westonruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) asked for a final review of [https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/8412](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/8412)

[@gziolo](https://profiles.wordpress.org/gziolo/) would like to clarify the process for including Abilities in WP 6.9 ( [See Slack thread](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C08TJ8BPULS/p1760363908571179)).

## Open floor ¬†üéôÔ∏è

Any topic can be raised for discussion in the comments, as well as requests for assistance on tickets. Tickets in the milestone for the next major or maintenance release will be prioritized.

Please include details of tickets / PRs and the links in the comments, and indicate whether you intend to be available during the meeting for discussion or will be async.

[#6-9](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/6-9/), [#agenda](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/agenda/), [#core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core/), [#dev-chat](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-chat/)

After considerable changes to the designed interface, `WP_Block_Scanner` is ready for final review.

This class introduces a streaming low-overhead method for processing block documents in a similar way to how the HTMLAPI is designed to process HTML.

It has undergone a lot of change over the past few months and the PR links to a couple of example refactors with potential for a large performance payoff, particularly when trying to extract a portion of a block within a larger document.

[wordpress/wordpress-develop#9105](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/9105) ‚Äî [Core-61401](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/61401)

- [Login to Reply](https://login.wordpress.org/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fmake.wordpress.org%2Fcore%2F2025%2F10%2F14%2Fdev-chat-agenda-october-15-2025%2F%23comment-47920&locale=en_US)

There‚Äôs an old discussion about PHP‚Äôs deprecation of `utf8_encode()` and `utf8_decode()`. Recent work on UTF-8 support has made it easier today to conditionally provide polyfills for those functions, polyfills which include appropriate deprecation notices for developers.

It would be nice to see some new thoughts on this since it was last active 18 months ago. There are additional concerns in the ticket for Core work, but a polyfill in Core can alleviate a number of concerns with the coming changes to PHP while preventing sites from crashing.

The Terms Query block effort needs more feedback on the [main issue](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/49094) and a few PRs to maybe stabilize the block for 6.9, mainly summarized by this comment: [https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/49094#issuecomment-3402959782](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/49094#issuecomment-3402959782)

The most important PRs in particular are:

Feature enhancement, selected terms: [https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72286](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72286)

## Discussion üí¨

### Gutenberg subprojects status update

[@krupajnanda](https://profiles.wordpress.org/krupajnanda/) asked for an update on several Gutenberg subprojects, and [@youknowriad](https://profiles.wordpress.org/youknowriad/) provided some useful info about their status:

- Stretchy Type Block: Already merged. See [PR 71904](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/71904).
- ‚ÄúSimplified Site Editing‚Äù experiment / ‚Äúcontent-only patterns‚Äù features: They are the same thing with different approach. The latter (content-only patterns) is the most promising approach and is close to land but it is not 100% sure it will be ready for 6.9.

### WordCamp Verona‚Äôs contributor day

[@realloc](https://profiles.wordpress.org/realloc/) mentioned that he will lead the Core table at WordCamp Verona‚Äôs contributor day, and asked if there was any specific focus to help during the day. [@audrasjb](https://profiles.wordpress.org/audrasjb/) provided a link to the [19 tickets waiting for proper testing in milestone 6.9](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&keywords=~needs-testing&milestone=6.9&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=changetime&col=keywords&order=priority).

### Improving error handling ( `wp_die()`¬†replacements)

[@callumbw95](https://profiles.wordpress.org/callumbw95/)¬†opened ticket[#64009](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/64009), which proposes reviewing and updating existing¬†`wp_die()`¬†calls that currently result in 500 errors. The goal is to establish a more consistent approach to error handling and reduce unnecessary error entries in logs.

[@westonruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) agreed on the approach: ‚ÄúSince WordPress has always been about semantic markup, it makes sense that it use semantic HTTP status codes as well. In the same way we don‚Äôt use `<div>` for everything, `wp_die()` shouldn‚Äôt use 500 for everything‚Äù.

[@callumbw95](https://profiles.wordpress.org/callumbw95/) added that ‚Äúthe added benefit is that the debug logs will reduce in size as there are a lot of errors that can be resolved client side (401, 403, etc) that don‚Äôt need to sit in the error logs‚Äù.

[@mindctrl](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mindctrl/) is in the process of reviewing/testing the PR with all the AJAX changes to make sure client side JS isn‚Äôt impacted.

### Template Output Buffering

Ticket [#43258](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43258) ( [PR#8412](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/8412#issuecomment-3344496798)) suggests adding a standardized output buffering layer in Core. This could unify caching and optimization flows and reduce plugin conflicts. The risk is considered low, though there are concerns about potential effects on TTFB and plugin behavior. Clear documentation and testing will be needed.

[@westonruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) asked for feedback: ‚ÄúIf anyone has input regarding standardizing template output buffering for the sake of optimization or caching, or if anyone has experience with streaming the HTML for templates specifically without output buffering, I‚Äôd appreciate your feedback on [that thread](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1759938614485459), or the ticket [#43258](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43258), or [the PR](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/8412)‚Äú.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs new in Gutenberg‚Ä¶‚Äù posts (labeled with the [#gutenberg-new tag](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/gutenberg-new/)) are posted following every Gutenberg release on a biweekly basis, showcasing new features included in each release. As a reminder, [here‚Äôs an overview](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/05/20/ways-to-keep-up-with-full-site-editing-fse/) of different ways to keep up with Gutenberg and the Editor.

What‚Äôs New In

Gutenberg 21.8?

Gutenberg 21.8 has been released and is [available for download](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/)!

> This version introduces **Block Visibility controls**, along with several improvements to **Block Comments**, **Accordion**, and **Time To Read** blocks.

1. [Block Visibility Control Support and UI](https://make.wordpress.org/core/#block-visibility-support-ui)
2. [Block Comments Improvements](https://make.wordpress.org/core/#block-comments-improvements)
3. [Accordion and Time To Read Blocks](https://make.wordpress.org/core/#accordion-time-to-read)
4. [Changelog](https://make.wordpress.org/core/#changelog)

## Block Visibility Control Support and UI

A new visibility control feature has landed!

You can now hide blocks directly in the editor when they won‚Äôt be displayed on the frontend. This marks the first UI for **Block Visibility**, paving the way for more granular design control in future releases.

## Block Comments Improvements

Block Comments received another round of enhancements:

- Better messaging when no related block exists
- Visual highlighting of the referenced block
- Improved comment thread outline and UI polish
- Simplified code and better performance

## Accordion and Time To Read Blocks

Both of these blocks have been refined for a smoother experience:

- **Time To Read:** now includes **range** and **word count** options, plus migration support for older blocks.
- **Accordion:** improved structure, naming, and accessibility.

## **WordPress Performance Trac tickets**

- [@westonruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) mentioned ticket[#63636](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63636) related to BFCache was punted due to an unresolved Chromium bug around `Clear-Site-Data: "cache"` headers.
- [@westonruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) identified ticket [#43258](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43258) on output buffering as the current biggest blocker. He explained that while there‚Äôs been significant discussion both on the PR [#8412](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/8412) and in [Slack](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1759334728882769), the debate centers around the trade-offs between enabling full-page buffering (to allow post-render optimization) versus keeping the door open for streaming, which could improve initial load performance. He provided further context on how classic themes already stream via procedural rendering, while block themes generally do not.

  - [@westonruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) noted that while streaming isn‚Äôt widely adopted in WordPress today, it could become valuable in the future, and care should be taken not to block its evolution. He also shared a [WPDirectory search](https://wpdirectory.net/search/01K6ZKWQ7KE3QWN24PXTJY61JW) of `flush()` usage across core, noting they appear mostly in admin and XML-RPC contexts rather than template rendering.
  - [@westonruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) asked if anyone has insights into this area and can contribute thoughts on how we can bridge these two perspectives, allowing for a default output buffer while also enabling streaming if the application wants it. He‚Äôd be most thankful.
- [@b1ink0](https://profiles.wordpress.org/b1ink0/) brought up PR [#9867](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/9867) related to footer script module support and noted that [@jonsurrell](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jonsurrell/) had provided thoughts around dependency handling.

## **Performance Lab Plugin (and other performance plugins)**

- [@westonruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) mentioned new guidance on AI-generated contributions now available in the Performance repo, including a new `AGENTS.md` file and updated PR template instructions with PR [#2193](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/pull/2193). He explained that this was prompted by a recent increase in AI-assisted PRs, some of which indicated the AI‚Äôs output wasn‚Äôt being carefully reviewed by the contributor.

## **Open Floor**

- [@westonruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) introduced Trac ticket [#64066](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/64066), proposing that WordPress default to `moderate` eagerness for Speculative Loading, when caching is detected. He noted the idea could provide a performance boost in WordPress 7.0 by improving preload efficiency on cached sites, but also acknowledged the need to weigh sustainability concerns around increased server load.

  - [@mukesh27](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mukesh27/) asked whether a second opinion was needed, and whether any Google team members had provided feedback.
  - [@westonruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) replied that he had received positive input from Google, though their priorities don‚Äôt always align with those of hosts and site owners. He noted that moderate eagerness can increase bandwidth usage due to unnecessary preloads and may lead to added hosting costs.
  - [@gilbertococchi](https://profiles.wordpress.org/gilbertococchi/) shared his thoughts, emphasizing that moderate eagerness could be significantly more impactful than conservative loading, especially with Chrome‚Äôs recent introduction of a Viewport Heuristic, but stressed the importance of safeguards like persistent object caching to mitigate server load.
  - [@mukesh27](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mukesh27/) summarized that [@gilbertococchi](https://profiles.wordpress.org/gilbertococchi/) was supportive of the proposal and encouraged moving the ticket into the 6.9 milestone for visibility.
  - [@westonruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) clarified that while he wasn‚Äôt necessarily aiming for inclusion in 6.9, he agreed to milestone the ticket for tracking purposes, with the understanding that it may still be punted.

**Our next chat will be held on [Tuesday, October 21, 2025 at 11:00 AM EDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20251021T1500) in the [#core-performance channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-performance/) in [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/)**.

## Site updates and new posts

## New posts

- [Border radius size presets in WordPress 6.9](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2025/09/border-radius-size-presets-in-wordpress-6-9/) by [@greenshady](https://profiles.wordpress.org/greenshady/)

[@webcommsat](https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/): the What‚Äôs New for Developers series is a very useful tool and how we are using tags, making it easier to find the information.

## Movements on some articles in progress

shout-out to [@davidperez](https://wordpress.slack.com/team/U030LQERD) who is about to publish his first blog post next week, [@magdalenapaciorek](https://wordpress.slack.com/team/U7NA44Y0G) who will push her long-simmering article over the finish line

There are two approved articles that still need a writer:

- [#334 Linting all things in IDE ‚Äì the ultimate doc](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/issues/334)
- [#305 Extending User profile views natively with DataViews](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/issues/305)

If you know someone who might be a good fit, let [@bph](https://profiles.wordpress.org/bph/) know, and we can onboard them quickly. [@bph](https://profiles.wordpress.org/bph/) has been doing outreach to previous writers and those who have open issues.

## New topic ideas

- [Styling accordions in Gutenberg/WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/discussions/405) GitHub issue [#410](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/issues/410)
- [Styling inputs, textareas, and select dropdowns in WordPress 6.9](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/discussions/407) GitHub issue [#411](https://make.wordpress.org/core/#411%20Styling%20inputs,%20textareas,%20and%20select%20dropdowns%20in%20WordPress%206.9)
  - [@webcommsat](https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/): highlighted the importance of this piece, and offered to be one of the reviewers
- [DataViews & DataForm Enhancements coming in WordPress 6.9](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/discussions/408) ‚Äì GitHub issue [#412](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/issues/412)
- [How to Create and Use Custom supports in Gutenberg Blocks](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/discussions/404) ‚Äì GitHub issue [#413](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/issues/413)

The next three are for a new topic category on the Developer Blog‚ÄîArtificial Intelligence and WordPress core. This will feature some areas from the new AI core team.

- [An Introduction to the WordPress Abilities API](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/discussions/398) ‚Äì GitHub [Issue #414](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/issues/414)
- [An Introduction to the WordPress PHP AI Client](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/discussions/397) ‚Äì GitHub [Issue #415](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/issues/415)
- [An Introduction to the WordPress MCP Adapter](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/discussions/399) ‚Äì GitHub [Issue #416](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/issues/416)
- [Building Dynamic Experiences combining different WordPress/Gutenberg features: Word Switcher project](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/discussions/409) ‚Äì GitHub [Issue #417](https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/issues/417)

[@webcommsat](https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/) highlighted as a potential to add to the list of useful posts for meetups.

[@psykro](https://profiles.wordpress.org/psykro/) ‚Äì personal plan is to get the Abilities post published close to the 6.9 release, the MCP adapter post soon after, and then follow up with the PHP AI SDK post. The aim is to try to build something that ties all three together so they can be read as a three-part series or individually. The proposal by [@juanmaguitar](https://profiles.wordpress.org/juanmaguitar/) for templates was suggested to be used as an example.

The new content items approved and [@bph](https://profiles.wordpress.org/bph/) will create the issues later next week and assign them to writers.

It was agreed that WordPress 6.9 had some great feature in store for developers

## Next meeting

The next Developer Blog editorial group meeting will be on [Sunday, November 2, 2025 at 10:00 AM EST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20251102T1500) in the [#core-dev-blog](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C03RL47B3S8) channel.
