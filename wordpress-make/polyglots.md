The French translation team will do its best to get your request accepted ASAP. You can have more info [how we handle PTE requests](https://fr.wordpress.org/2015/12/18/how-french-community-handles-pte-requests/).

Can you also get in touch on the French Slack #traductions channel using our [direct invitation link](https://join.slack.com/t/wordpressfr/shared_invite/zt-b7l3dbj4-vxEUcxPBX~6TuUG0cwIemA).

We have a few recommendations before giving PTE‚Äôs access.

Please keep in mind the French Glossary and Guidelines available in our [Handbook](https://fr.wordpress.org/team/handbook/) as well.

Merci

A small correction/clarification to what [@timse201](https://profiles.wordpress.org/timse201/) said:

If you **personally** know all these languages, then the PTE role is the right way to go.

But it‚Äôs important to remember that PTE is a **personal translation contributor role**.

If the translations were done by **different people**, for instance various users of your plugin, then each of them would be the right candidate as PTE for their respective language.

CLPTE would be the right role if these translators were made by **professional, duly instructed translators**. (your, for instance, inform them about style guides for various locales. ( [https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/glossaries-and-style-guides-per-locale/](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/glossaries-and-style-guides-per-locale/) )

If your idea is to upload machine translations without knowing the target language, please don‚Äôt. That would be against our [general expectations](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/expectations/), and would quickly generate a large amount of inefficient work for unpaid volunteer contributors.
