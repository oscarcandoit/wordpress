## Welcome!

The [WordPress Photo Directory](https://wordpress.org/photos/) is a directory of free, publicly-contributed, CC0-licensed photographs.

The Photo Directory team moderates every photo submitted to the directory, maintains and improves the directory site itself, and provides resources and documentation to educate, encourage, and facilitate photo contributors.

If you’re a new contributor, welcome! You can come chat with us in [#Photos](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/photos/) on Slack.

Stay tuned as we develop our contributor handbook. If you’ve encountered an issue or have a suggestion for the Photo Directory, feel free to [create a ticket](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/newticket?component=Photo%20Directory).

We encourage you to [submit](https://wordpress.org/photos/submit/) one or more of your best photos to our directory!

Hello everyone,

Thank you for your enthusiasm and participation in the recent vote for our new team representatives. We were excited to announce the results during WordCamp US Contributor Day tomorrow, but we’ve decided to take a little extra time to ensure everything is in place for a smooth transition.

We are currently reviewing some important legal details regarding the team leadership roles and countries of residence, and we also want to personally connect with the top candidates to confirm their willingness and availability to take on these responsibilities. This extra step ensures that our new reps are fully prepared to serve our community.

We’re looking forward to sharing the results during our next team meeting on **October 4th, 2024**. Your continued support and understanding are greatly appreciated, and we can’t wait to introduce the new team representatives soon!

In August, after 2.5 years of the current Photo Directory representatives holding their positions, the team opened up nominations for just the second time. The poll is now open and ready for your vote.

Where can I vote?

Right here!

[https://poll.fm/14300333](https://poll.fm/14300333)

You can vote for up to two people at the same time. Once you have submitted your vote, you won’t be able to vote again.

To see what team reps are responsible for, see the [previous post calling for Photo Directory Team Rep nominations](https://make.wordpress.org/photos/2024/08/15/call-for-photo-directory-team-representatives/). For now the Photo Directory Team anticipates electing two or three team reps. Of course, team reps can decide to add additional people as team reps, during the course of the year.

This poll will be open until Friday, September 13, 2024, after which team reps will be selected based on the votes received. Stay tuned for that announcement post as well as the live announcement at WordCamp US Contributor Day in Portland!

The Make WordPress Photo team is in need of two-to-three new Team Reps to assume this role. After 2+ years serving in this role and discussing our current availability at length, [@katiejrichards](https://profiles.wordpress.org/katiejrichards/), [@topher1kenobe](https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/), and [@mdburnette](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mdburnette/) are ready to pass the proverbial torch.

### What is a Team Rep?

Ideally, all Make WordPress teams should have at least two representatives, allowing them to share responsibilities, divide tasks, and cover each other when needed.

Team Reps work with other teams across the project, share key updates across all contributor teams, and generally help to support the team as a whole.

- Team Rep is an organizational role that is mostly administrative in nature; it is not a Lead role.

- Letting go of the Team Rep title is not a loss of status, just a handing off of responsibilities.

- Someone who is a leader in a team can lead whether they are doing the team rep job or not.


### What to Expect in the Role?

Expectations vary from team to team, but here are some of what to expect:

- Prepare meeting agenda by requesting updates from Photo Directory working groups

- Conduct the team’s monthly meetings on the Make Photos Slack channel

- Document meeting notes and share updates with other teams as necessary


Additional information can be found in [the Photo Directory handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/photos/handbook).

### What are our Next Steps?

- **Call for Nominations**: Anyone can nominate a Photo Directory team rep! (Yes, you can nominate yourself!) The deadline for nominations is _Friday, August 30th_.

- **Voting for Team Reps**: Nominees will be officially announced on _Monday, September 2_, and a poll for voting will be available the same day. It will stay open until _Friday, September 13th_. After that, the new team reps will be announced on Contributor Day at WordCamp US (and here on the Make Photos blog) on _September 17_!


**Are YOU interested in contributing? Just provide a name in the comments section of this post.**

Please nominate people for Photo Directory team rep in the comments of this post by _Friday, August 30_. Self-nominations are welcome.

Remember, a best practice before nominating someone is to check in with them first! If you are nominated, you do not have to say yes. Only people who respond positively to a nomination will be added to the poll, so please feel free to decline if you don’t feel that being team rep is the right fit for any reason.

If you have any questions, please do ask those in the comments!

A big thank you from the photos team and wider to the current team reps [@katiejrichards](https://profiles.wordpress.org/katiejrichards/), [@topher1kenobe](https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/), and [@mdburnette](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mdburnette/) for their enthusiasm, time and contribution during the last two years. Looking forward to continuing to contribute alongside them in various projects including the photo directory.

I nominate [@mbigul](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mbigul/)!

Excellent nomination, +1 from me – I have shared more details on my nomination in a comment below.

+1 for [@mbigul](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mbigul/)

I nominate [@samalderson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/samalderson/)!

I would love to self nominate be a team representative of the Photo Team! This team is fabulous and I would love to be more involved and take on a larger role.

I nominate myself.

Hey all, I would love to nominate myself!

I nominate Roy Tanck!

I would like to nominate myself. I think there is a lot that I could bring to the role.

👋 Not an active member of this team, but I would like to nominate [@mbigul](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mbigul/) for the Team Representative Role. He has so much interest and passion for the Photos Directory, and currently (unless I am mistaken), he has submitted the most number of photos in the Directory, and spends significant amounts of time consistently moderating photos. His efforts spearheded the Kerala WordPress Photo Festival (of which I was also a co-organizer), which – I feel, significantly helped and supported the team. I strongly feel that Bigul will make an excellent Team Representative for the Photos Team.

> I nominate @mbigul!

Thank you [@markmemayank](https://profiles.wordpress.org/markmemayank/) for the support 🙂

Thank you very much [@harishanker](https://profiles.wordpress.org/harishanker/) , [@hellosatya](https://profiles.wordpress.org/hellosatya/) and [@mkrndmane](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mkrndmane/) for supporting me.

I would like to accept your nominations. I always love being part of the Photo Directory, and together, we can explore more innovative ways to improve it.

I would like to nominate myself. I’m ready to take on new challenges to benefit the team.

Thank you everyone for the nominations. Nominations are now closed and you can [vote for your team representatives](https://make.wordpress.org/photos/2024/09/02/photo-directory-team-reps-2024-submit-your-votes/) on the latest post!
