## Welcome to the official blog for the WordPress Support team.

Need help with a WordPress issue? You can find help with your WordPress problem by posting in the [support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/forums/) or asking on the [#wordpress](https://make.wordpress.org/support/irc-support-channel/) IRC channel.

### Want to get involved?

Answering a question in the support forums or on IRC is one of the easiest ways to get started. Everyone knows the answer to something!

We have a [detailed handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/) to help contributors learn how to work with the forums and IRC.

### Weekly Meetings

As well as discussing support issues here on the blog, we use [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) for group communication.

Our meetings are held fortnightly on Thursday at 17:00 UTC, in [#forums](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/forums/) on Slack, with agendas published below.

**Note:  No meetings are currently scheduled.**

To encourage broader adoption of secure and supported database versions, WordPress should clarify that only LTS releases of MySQL and MariaDB are officially supported by excluding those with short lifespans or no guarantee of backward compatibility. As a community, we frequently champion efforts to keep software and tools updated to their latest versions. This typically surfaces for users in the form of PHP upgrades, and for contributors with tools like Node.js and npm. Database software is equally important to site health but has historically received far less attention. The release models followed by supported database types…")

To support this effort, every repository was catalogued in a spreadsheet, along with metadata to assess which met the established criteria. This includes factors such as ongoing maintenance, alignment with an active WordPress.org team or initiative, and whether the repository serves a continuing purpose.

The WordPress forums is a space where people communicate with each other to request and provide support. If a company or brand use a branded account as the owner of a plugin (or theme), such an account usually gets the support role “Spectator”, which means that this account is NOT allowed to post in the forums.

In February-March 2025 this situation has been emphasized more than recently, after the Plugin Directory started linking the “Plugin owner” field to the WordPress.org Profile of the plugin owner.

In order to post as an official representative of a plugin in our forums, each person must use their individual account. They are welcome to use a pseudonym if they don’t want to show their real name. It’s important that people DON’T SHARE accounts, and that nobody uses more than one account in the forums. This is primarily for security but also accountability. If an account gets suspended for guideline violations, this will only affect the specific individual and not the full team behind a shared account, something that might completely block an organization’s access to provide support in the forums, while at the same time you might not know exactly who violated the rules on behalf of the team.

Under the “Advanced” tab of a plugin, the plugin owner can add individual accounts as “Support representatives”. When these contributors post in the support or review forum of the plugin, their posts will be marked with a special badge. (Currently, March 2025, we still don’t have such functionality for themes.)
