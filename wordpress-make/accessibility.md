On [Thursday, October 2, 2025 at 11:00 PM GMT+8](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20251002T1500), a team meeting started in [#accessibility](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03) facilitated by [@muddassirnasim](https://profiles.wordpress.org/muddassirnasim/). You can read the [full transcript](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1759417211747119) or see the [meeting agenda](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2025/10/02/accessibility-team-meeting-agenda-oct-02-2025/).

## Biweekly Team Meeting Time Update

The bi-weekly chat meeting time has changed to alternate Thursdays at 15:00 UTC, and the meeting [calendar](https://make.wordpress.org/meetings/) is also updated.

## Bug Scrub Schedule for WordPress 6.9

The bug scrub [schedule](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/09/15/bug-scrub-schedule-for-wordpress-6-9/) for WordPress 6.9 has been prepared for its upcoming release.

## Updates from working groups

[Design](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1759417816815749)

[@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) reported that the admin redesign is officially no longer part of the 6.9 roadmap, so it will not be an immediate concern. This outcome was largely expected.

There will also not be a new default theme in this release cycle, which means design needs are relatively light.

[Documentation](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1759418014283229)

[@rianrietveld](https://profiles.wordpress.org/rianrietveld/) reported that the [WP Knowledge Base](https://wpaccessibility.org/) is now ready for contributions 🎉. All accessibility content from the current handbook has been copied into [wpaccessibility.org](https://wpaccessibility.org/), and placeholder pages have been created for new content. The [How to contribute](https://wpaccessibility.org/docs/contribute/) pages are finished, including information for contributors who don’t work with GitHub. A [tracking issue](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs/issues/85) is available with details on what still needs to be written.

Rian will write the web form documentation herself, as she has permission to use materials written for the Dutch government. Level Level, a Dutch WordPress agency specializing in accessibility, will conduct an official WCAG-EM audit on [wpaccessibility.org](https://wpaccessibility.org/) at the beginning of November, with the goal of having all accessibility issues fixed by then. Contributors are encouraged to pick tasks from the [projectboard Wp A11y Docs](https://github.com/orgs/wpaccessibility/projects/3), but should only contribute on topics they know well, as AI is not yet reliable in accessibility.

For October, [@rianrietveld](https://profiles.wordpress.org/rianrietveld/) will start writing content on web forms. [@aialvi](https://profiles.wordpress.org/aialvi/) will work on migrating the current handbook to a new GitHub repository on [github.com/wordpress](http://github.com/wordpress). [@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) and [@1fixdotio](https://profiles.wordpress.org/1fixdotio/) will focus on the remaining issues in the website itself.

[General](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1759418121842409)

[@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) reported that we are just under three weeks away from beta 1 of WordPress 6.9. **There are [19 tickets](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&focuses=~accessibility&milestone=6.9&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&order=priority) still in the milestone**, including five enhancements/features that need to be committed before beta. So far, **[25 tickets](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&focuses=~accessibility&milestone=6.9&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=milestone&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&order=priority) have been completed** for this milestone.

All enhancement and feature tickets were scrubbed on Tuesday and are in good shape, with most looking plausible to complete. However, a few are at risk. Ticket [#48655](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/48655) has had only minimal progress with some initial research, and ticket [#49876](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/49876) has seen no recent involvement from its contributor, meaning significant work is still needed.

Overall, the milestone is in good shape despite these concerns.

[Gutenberg](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1759418436078629)

[@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) reported that several major features are in progress that are important for accessibility, including the Icons block, Tab block, Accordion block, and Block Commenting. He has reviewed the Icons block, Accordion block, and Block Commenting, but has not yet had time to review the Tabs block.

Feedback on the Accordion block and Block Commenting is in good shape. However, the Icons block has been shifting directions frequently, and accessibility feedback has not yet been addressed. Joe plans to review the Tabs block this week and will revisit the Icons block to confirm whether his earlier feedback is still relevant after the changes.

There may be additional issues, but these are the main updates at this stage.

[Media](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1759418839322119)

[@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) reported that testing on ticket [#63895](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63895) is in progress, but more image sources are needed to ensure thorough results. In particular, images from major stock photo sites such as Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, Getty Images, iStock, and Alamy would be helpful. Contributors who have access to new images from these sources are encouraged to share them with @saj1ad, who is collecting them.

This ticket is not currently set for the 6.9 milestone but could be included if these issues are addressed in time.

[Themes](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1759419079743749)

[@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) noted that @amberhinds is working on the theme accessibility ready guide. However, with [WP Accessibility Day](https://2025.wpaccessibility.day/) happening in less than two weeks, it is unlikely that there will be updates on this work until November.

[@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) also mentioned that it may be difficult for him to attend the next meeting, since Accessibility Day will be ending just as the meeting begins.

NOTE: If you’d like to have a topic added to the agenda for our next meeting, please mention it in the [comments on an upcoming agenda](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/).

Thank you, [@krupajnanda](https://profiles.wordpress.org/krupajnanda/) for the pre-publish review.

The Accessibility Team bug scrub is every Tuesday at 15:00 UTC, held in the [#accessibility](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/C02RP4X03) channel on the Make WordPress Slack ( [registration required](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/)).

[#accessibility](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/tag/accessibility/), [#agenda](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/tag/agenda/)

This update informs you about:

- The Knowledge Base is ready to contribute.
- Issues on GitHub with what needs to be written or reviewed.
- The work planned for October 2025.
- How you can help.

## Knowledge Base is ready to contribute

In September we made the website [wpaccessibility.org](https://wpaccessibility.org/) ready to contribute. All accessibility content from the [current handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/) is copied into this website. Also new placeholder pages are made, for new content.

Yoren Chang [@1fixdotio](https://profiles.wordpress.org/1fixdotio/) worked hard to create a preview option for pull requests for the site, so everyone can review proposed content without needing a local install. She is really amazing.

The [How to contribute](https://wpaccessibility.org/docs/contribute/) pages are written, also for contributors who don’t work with GitHub and just want to write or review.

## GitHub issues with what needs to be written or reviewed

Rian wrote issues on GitHub for each documentation page belonging to [Standards and best practice](https://wpaccessibility.org/docs/topics/). For review and rewrite of the content. Each issues is labeled by topic.

For example the page [Headings in the content](https://wpaccessibility.org/docs/topics/content/headings/) now has an alert, about what needs be done with the content and a link to the [related GitHub issue](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs/issues/106).

## How can you help?

On [How to contribute](https://wpaccessibility.org/docs/contribute/) you can read the different ways to contribute to this project. If you want to help writing, pick an issue from the [list of Todo issues on the projectboard Wp A11y Docs](https://github.com/orgs/wpaccessibility/projects/3). Only contribute if you know the topic well or have good resources to share.

**Note**: Please write the content yourself and use AI only to translate or to check the quality of your English.

## Plans for October

[@rianrietveld](https://profiles.wordpress.org/rianrietveld/) will start writing content for the Knowledge Base, now everything is mapped out. She will also give presentations about the project at the [WPMeetup020](https://www.meetup.com/nl-NL/wordpress-amsterdam/events/307231059/) (Amsterdam) and [WPMeetup030](https://www.meetup.com/nl-NL/wordpress-meetup-utrecht/events/310887927/?eventOrigin=group_events_list) (Utrecht). You can help her by sponsoring [Rian’s time and expenses](https://github.com/sponsors/rianrietveld/).

[@Aminul](https://profiles.wordpress.org/aminul/) will work on the migration of the current handbook to a new Github repo accessibility-team-handbook on github.com/wordpress. Only the Accessibility Team related info will stay into that handbook.

[@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) and [@1fixdotio](https://profiles.wordpress.org/1fixdotio/) work on the remaining issues in wpaccessibility.org itself.

## Bug Scrub Schedule for WordPress 6.9

The bug scrub [schedule](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/09/15/bug-scrub-schedule-for-wordpress-6-9/) for WordPress 6.9 has been prepared for its upcoming release.

## Announcing the Core Program Team

The recent launch of the [Core Program team,](https://make.wordpress.org/project/2025/09/15/announcing-the-core-program-team/) which is an expansion of the previous Core AI Team program model.

## Updates from working groups

[Documentation](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1758208517869639)

[@rianrietveld](https://profiles.wordpress.org/rianrietveld/) reported that the team has been working to make wpaccessibility.org ready for contributions. They have copied all accessibility content from the current handbook into the new site and created placeholder pages for new content. [@1fixdotio](https://profiles.wordpress.org/1fixdotio/) has implemented a preview option for Pull Requests so contributors can review proposed content without a local install.

[@rianrietveld](https://profiles.wordpress.org/rianrietveld/) also suggested including more people to work on the content of the documentation, and provides a [list of Todo issues](https://github.com/orgs/wpaccessibility/projects/3) for people to contribute to, but cautions that contributors should only work on topics they know well, as AI is not yet very good at accessibility.

Aminul will work on the migration of the current handbook to a new GitHub repo, accessibility-team-handbook

Only the Accessibility Team-related info will stay in that handbook.

[General](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1758210942795229)

[@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) reported that [@alh0319](https://profiles.wordpress.org/alh0319/) raised several new tickets that were reviewed in the bug scrub last week.

[Gutenberg](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1758210942795229)

[@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) has raised comments on the Icon block and Block Commenting in Gutenberg, and needs to review the Tab block and Accordion block.

[Media](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1758210942795229)

[@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) reopened the discussion on whether to import alt text from image metadata, noting the pros and cons both.

[Meta](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1758210942795229)

Updated the Current Release tracking [document](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/current-release-progress/).

[Themes](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1758210942795229)

[@alh0319](https://profiles.wordpress.org/alh0319/) will be working on converting existing documents into markdown and adding them to a repository in the WP Accessibility organisation so that we can coordinate with other docs processes.

NOTE: If you’d like to have a topic added to the agenda for our next meeting, please mention it in the [comments on an upcoming agenda](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/).

## Accessibility Team Meeting Schedule

The team discussed finding the best meeting time that works across different groups, with [@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) and the other team reps working to propose options for a vote. _The new meeting time is to be announced soon!_

## Updates from working groups

[Design](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1756913862724239)

- [@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) shared that the design working group’s main focus is the admin redesign, which is a large and complex project that’s difficult to track. He emphasised the importance of reviewing new interfaces for accessibility since current work is mostly limited to design proposals. He also pointed out that specific areas, such as Block Commenting, need more design attention and shared a related [GitHub issue](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/249/views/1) for reference.

[Documentation](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1756914168347639)

- [@rianrietveld](https://profiles.wordpress.org/rianrietveld/) and [@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) are working on new Accessibility documentation, which can be followed on the make/accessibility [blog](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/tag/wp-a11y-docs) with the hashtag [#wp-a11y-docs](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/tag/wp-a11y-docs/). They are getting more contributors to help with this effort.

[General](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1756914454551309)

- [@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) reported on progress with core tickets, noting that 28 tickets were assigned to the 6.9 milestone, 7 were punted due to inactivity, and 18 have been committed. He also introduced a large patch on [#40428 ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40428) related to hiding CSS-generated content from assistive technologies and requested testing support.
- Joe shared that he audited the WordPress admin for CSS-generated content issues, made changes to ensure dashicons selectors use generated empty alternatives, and emphasised the need to verify there are no visual differences in updated code. [@krupajnanda](https://profiles.wordpress.org/krupajnanda/) suggested a potential “call for testing” post and requested instructions on how to test, to which Joe confirmed he would prepare guidance.

[Gutenberg Team](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1756915066734799)

- [@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) shared that the Gutenberg items and the implementation of the [Lightbox in Galleries](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/62906) are the most relevant things that need testing.

[Media](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1756915235597109)

- [@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) mentioned he had a discussion point but preferred to defer it to the next meeting due to time constraints. He requested adding _“Discuss integration of media metadata sourced alt text”_ to the next meeting’s agenda.

[Meta](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1756915360741229)

- No updates were reported.

[Themes](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1756915435615369)

- [@joedolson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/) reported that work is still ongoing to complete the accessibility-ready themes documentation, with _Amber Hinds_ set to follow up on that.

[Open Floor](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4X03/p1756915500594649)

- Nothing major was discussed during the open floor.

The Accessibility Team bug scrub is every Tuesday at 15:00 UTC.

This meeting is held in the [#accessibility](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/C02RP4X03) channel on the Make WordPress Slack ( [registration required](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/)).

[#accessibility](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/tag/accessibility/), [#agenda](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/tag/agenda/)

How’s the work going on the documentation for WordPress about accessibility (WP A11y Docs).

This update informs you about:

- the brainstorm session about the content;
- new contributors that joined in;
- the work planned for September 2025;
- how you can help.

**Note**: The new website for the Knowledge Base is stil in its set up phase: content needs to be added, accessibility issues need to be fixed. So we will not publish the URL here yet, but if you want to see the progress, please visit the [GitHub repo wp-a11y-docs](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs) and follow the link mentioned there.

## Brainstorm session about the content

![Paul van Buuren, Annelies Verhelst, Wendie Huis in't Veld , Savi Sinnema, Caitlin de Rooij, Johan Huijkman and Rian Rietveld proudly standing before a wall of post-its.](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/files/2025/08/signal-2025-08-20-173622_002_720.jpg)

In our [previous update](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2025/08/08/update-project-wp-a11y-docs/) we shared the plans for the setup of the Knowledge Base. In Phase 1 we are going to gather all information about accessibility for people that use or build for WordPress and add that to website.

But how to organise that the best way? With a group of seven people, involved in WordPress and/or accessibility, we brainstormed about this for an afternoon. Resulting in a wall full of Post-its.

Thank you Paul van Buuren ( [@paulvanbuuren](https://profiles.wordpress.org/paulvanbuuren/)), Annelies Verhelst ( [@anneliesjenl](https://profiles.wordpress.org/anneliesjenl/)), Wendie Huis in’t Veld ( [@dolgelukkig](https://profiles.wordpress.org/dolgelukkig/)), Savi Sinnema, Caitlin de Rooij and Johan Huijkman!

The main conclusions where:

- There needs to be a section about how to start, where to begin if you are new to accessibility and have no clue where to start.
- To help users get to the knowledge they need, a reading guide is necessary. Per target group about what they need to read and where to find it. Content must be published once, but the way to get there can differ.
- How to test was the most requested topic in the survey “ [Which WP accessibility documentation do you need](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2025/06/26/results-survey-which-wp-accessibility-documentation-do-you-need/)”. There must be dedicated menu item with how to and checklists.
- Each of the “Topics” with a “Standards and best practice” menu item will also have a “how to test” section.
- The point of this Knowledge base is not to rewrite all the content there is out there but to write down what’s important in this context and link to reliable resources.

You can find the full report of the brainstorm session in the Google Doc: [Brainstorm session WP A11y Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fXxyXjEDuwKgAGUA1a1pBtUcHPF2E7bfdANOpMCbCrc/).

## New contributors join in

Kudos to Yoren Chang ( [@yoren](https://profiles.wordpress.org/yoren/)) for making it possible to preview pull requests for the website in GitHub pages. Annelies Verhelst is helping with content reviews. Gary Jones ( [@garyj](https://profiles.wordpress.org/garyj/)) set up the rights for the wp-a11y-docs repo and helps with pull requests. The [NL Design System](https://nldesignsystem.nl/) gave permission to translate Dutch content into English and publish it on the Knowledge Base.

## Work planned for September 2025

- Copy all accessibility information from the current handbook to the new website.
- Move the info that needs to stay in the [current handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/) to a repo on the WordPress account and publish the handbook from there.
- Work on extending the content in the Knowledge Base.
- Fix the accessibility issues on the website.

You can follow the work in our [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/orgs/wpaccessibility/projects/3).
