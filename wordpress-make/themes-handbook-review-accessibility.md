**How to be “Accessibility Ready”**

This is an optional stage of the theme review process. Submitted themes (or theme updates) that use the tag `accessibility-ready` will undergo an accessibility review to check against these guidelines. Themes with this tag may not be made live in the theme repository until they have passed an accessibility audit. You are encouraged to exceed these requirements; these are the minimum requirements for the tag.

**Did your theme fail the accessibility audit?**

If a reviewer finds accessibility issues in your theme that need to be fixed, you will have the opportunity to update your theme to meet the accessibility guidelines or to remove the **accessibility-ready** tag.

Themes that fail the accessibility review will still be approved for addition to the Theme Repository, but must remove the tag before they can be made live.

**Did your theme pass the accessibility audit?**

Congratulations! Your theme can be found under the [accessibility-ready](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready) tag.

You can reference the [Accessibility Team’s pattern library](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/a11ythemepatterns) for creating accessible themes as an aid in getting your theme ready for the `accessibility-ready` tag.

Themes labeled as `accessibility-ready` have met the required guidelines listed here, and should not be construed to meet [any level of formal accessibility requirements](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/make/which-questions-should-you-ask/#levels-of-accessibility). Those levels are measurements of content accessibility, and cannot be applied to a theme.

**Requesting an accessibility review of a live theme**

When an existing theme is updated with an `accessibility-ready` tag, the theme is sorted into the [accessibility queue](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&keywords=~accessibility-ready&changetime=90+days..&groupdesc=1&owner=themetracbot&report=29&col=id&col=summary&col=changetime&col=resolution&col=owner&col=reporter&desc=1&order=changetime) on the trac repository. Once the accessibility review is completed, the theme author will receive a message with the recommendations. If the theme author fails to make adequate corrections promptly, it could result in suspension from the directory.
