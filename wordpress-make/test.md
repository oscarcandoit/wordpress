[Here](https://github.com/WordPress/test-handbook/pulls) are the handbook Pull requests and [here](https://github.com/WordPress/test-handbook/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22Project%3A%20Mirror%22) are the pending tasks for review.

[#core-test](https://make.wordpress.org/test/tag/core-test/), [#gutenberg](https://make.wordpress.org/test/tag/gutenberg/)

As part of the upcoming **WordPress 6.9 release**, we are introducing a brand-new block, the **Accordion block**.

This block was first introduced in the [**Gutenberg 21.5 release**](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/08/28/whats-new-in-gutenberg-21-5/#introducing-accordion-block) as an [**experimental feature**](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/64119) and is now being stabilised. More testing is needed to ensure its reliability and polish before it ships with the WordPress 6.9 release.

## **What is the Accordion block?**

The Accordion block lets you display collapsible sections of content, which is ideal for FAQs, expandable information lists, etc.

- The block acts as a **container, i.e. Accordion** that holds multiple **child blocks, which we can consider as Accordion Items**
- By default, adding an Accordion block inserts **two Accordion Items**.
- Each item contains a title and an expandable content area that can be toggled open or closed.

Note: In the latest specification, only one accordion item is inserted. This will the new behavior in Gutenberg 21.9 Release. Please check [#72021](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72021#issuecomment-3365028665) PR for more details.

Now, before we start testing, let’s understand the difference between the **Accordion** and the **Details blocks.**

While both blocks allow collapsible content, their structure and purpose differ:

- **Accordion block:** Designed for **multiple collapsible grouped sections**, such as FAQ lists. It contains several Accordion Items inside a single parent block, as shown in the screenshot below.

[![](https://make.wordpress.org/test/files/2025/10/Accordion-block-structure-1024x427.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/test/files/2025/10/Accordion-block-structure.png)

- **Details block:** Intended for **a single collapsible section,** for example, a single “Read more” toggle as shown in the screenshot below.

[![](https://make.wordpress.org/test/files/2025/10/Details-block-1024x428.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/test/files/2025/10/Details-block.png)

## **Test Steps**

Please try out the Accordion block in the latest **Gutenberg plugin (v21.5 or later).** Here are some testing scenarios:

01. Visit `Gutenberg > Experiments` and check the option to “Enable experimental blocks”
02. Navigate to Post/Page or template
03. Verify you can add an `Accordion block` now.
04. Confirm that the **Accordion Item** is added with an **Accordion Heading** and an **Accordion Panel** (ref the screenshot above)
05. Edit item placeholders and add content inside the Accordion Panel
06. Save and confirm that expand/collapse both function as expected in the front end and the editor
07. **Verify Reordering**
    1. Move Accordion Items up or down
    2. Confirm that the order updates correctly in both the editor and the frontend
08. **Styling & Settings**: This only applies to all items when you work through the global styles. If you change the style of an item in a block instance, the style will not be reflected in other items.

    1. Apply block-level style settings (colors, typography, background, etc).
    2. Confirm that styles are reflected in all items consistently.
09. Verify the duplicate of the accordion block
10. Remove an existing item and ensure the block continues to function as expected

Discover more scenarios based on the different use cases and see if that works as expected. Refer to the visual below to understand how you can play around with different settings.

## **Testing Instruction**

## **Why Your Testing Matters**

Your feedback helps ensure the Accordion block offers a consistent, stable, and intuitive experience for all users, including the Accessibility considerations. If you encounter any related issues, please report them [here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/) **.**

**How to report an issue**

1. Write down step-by-step instructions on how an issue can be reproduced. Also, attach a screenshot/screencap for better clarity.
2. Use the [Test report plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/test-reports/) to collect all essential meta information.
3. Before creating a new issue, check if there is a related issue has already been reported in the Guutenberg repo. If not, create a new one [here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/).

A new feature is introduced in [**Gutenberg 21.8RC**](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v21.8.0-rc.1) **:** the ability to **hide blocks from the frontend.**

This option provides more flexibility for working with content and layouts. Instead of deleting or moving a block you don’t want published, you can temporarily hide it. The block remains in the editor, but it will not appear on the live site until the visibility is switched back on.

## **Why this matters**

- Makes it easier to experiment with different layouts without losing content.
- Allows draft or placeholder content to stay visible in the editor but hidden from site visitors.
- Encourages non-destructive editing and smoother collaboration.
- Creates a foundation for future enhancements

## **Key Changes to Observe**

- In the editor,
  - It adds a menu item to the block settings options to change the block’s visibility.
    - “Hide”: A “Hide” option appears on each block by default
    - “Show”: Clicking on “Hide”, the block setting toolbar should display the “Show” option.
  - In the List view, the visibility of multiple blocks can be changed simultaneously.

## **Test Steps**

1. Install and activate the [**Gutenberg plugin**](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases) **(V21.8RC)**. Alternatively, you can test this with this [playground link](https://playground.wordpress.net/?gutenberg-pr=71203#%7B%22landingPage%22:%22/wp-admin/%22,%22features%22:%7B%22networking%22:true%7D,%22steps%22:%5B%7B%22step%22:%22login%22,%22username%22:%22admin%22,%22password%22:%22password%22%7D%5D%7D).
2. Navigate to the post, page, or template.
3. Select the block and click on the **“Hide”** control from the toolbar settings
4. Observe that the block is no longer visible in the editor, and the “ **Show**” control should be toggled on for that block (Observe the List view)
5. Check the change in the front end, and the block should be hidden
6. Now, turn off the hide setting in the editor
7. The block should reappear in the editor and the front end
8. **Nested blocks**: Place a few blocks inside a Group/Columns block and hide the parent.

1. Confirm that all inner blocks are hidden
9. **Multiple instances**: Hide different blocks across the page and verify that only the chosen ones are excluded from the frontend.

## **Testing Instruction**

Since this feature is newly introduced, it needs testing, and feedback is especially valuable.

Please share:

- Did the toggle behave as expected?
- Did you run into inconsistencies between the editor and the frontend?
- Were there any issues with nested, synced, or reusable blocks?

Your input will help refine this feature as it moves toward the WordPress 6.9 release.

Follow [#71203](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/71203) PR for more details. If you observe any related issues, please feel free to report them [here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/).

## **📈Performance / Asset Check**

Hidden blocks should not appear on the frontend, and their related CSS/JS should no longer be actively used. Optionally, you can verify this via the **Network tab** or **CSS Coverage** in DevTools. Visible blocks must continue loading normally. On small pages, coverage differences may be subtle; the key point is that hidden blocks do not add frontend markup or assets. Check [#9213 PR](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/9213) for more details. If you would like to verify this, follow [the steps in the](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/9213#issuecomment-3387486657) comment.

If you’re unsure whether what you are experiencing is a bug, you can ask in the [#outreach](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C015GUFFC00) channel on the WordPress Slack.

It would be helpful to be able to click the eye in List View to make a block visible again. Making a block visible/invisible through the List View. As here one could even multi select of blocks in List View to then click the eye to make all the blocks visible again.

In regards to hidden blocks on the frontend, I wanted to call out that any scripts and styles associated with a hidden block may still get added to the frontend (needlessly). I’ve opened [#63676](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63676) to fix this, and there is an [associated PR](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/9213) that fixes the problem in my testing. It needs review and testing.

Sorry, I don’t want to be the party crasher, but the actual implementation (Gutenberg 2.8.1) doesn’t make any sense to me. And it is not what described in “Why this matters” above.

Hide a block in the frontend is really useful and much loved by my trainees, when using plugins like Greenshift or Block Visibility. But the main effect oft this tools is to hide the block ONLY in the frontend and NOT in the editor too.

The regular use-case is, as described above by yourself: “Allows draft or placeholder content to stay visible in the editor but hidden from site visitors.”

But the actual Gutenberg tool hides the block ALSO in the editor!

So, to work as described with a draft, you have to

1\. make a block visible

2\. edit it

3\. make it invisible again and

4\. save the post.

(And never forget step 3 before each saving!) – That’s a workflow from hell, but nothing I would use by myself or recommend to my trainees.

Additional, in the editor, you can’t never see what you have written in ALL invisible blocks and must make them visible one by one to see your own content. (And, by god, don’t forget to make them invisible again afterwards before next saving!)

Suggestions:

1.) Follow your own target declaration and make the block invisible ONLY in the frontend.

2.) If you want some extra, mark such a block in the editor, e.g. with a special wireframe, which declares its invisible frontend status at a glance.

3.) If there is no quick solution to make this feature useful, remove it from the upcoming WordPress release.

A recent [update to the Site Editor template management system](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67125) has significantly enhanced WordPress template management by providing greater flexibility and control over the template editing experience. It is now possible to view custom templates separately from theme templates, store more than one template per template type (or slug), edit templates and save them without making them active, manage template revisions more effectively, and mark specific templates as active or inactive according to requirements.

## Key Changes

- Template Management: Allows multiple templates with the same target slug and introduces the ability to switch between them by setting one as “active.”
- Theme Template Control: Users can now disable theme templates (except the essential index template)
- New UI: Adds “Active templates” and “Custom Templates” views in the Site Editor
- API Simplification: User templates now use standard Post Type REST API endpoints
- Enhanced Features: Enables revisions, duplication, and trashing through normal Post actions

## Benefits

- Custom templates are retained when switching themes
- Users can disable template edits when needed
- New templates can be created without immediately publishing
- Templates can be added for all slugs, not just missing ones
- Improvements to template revisions, template duplication, and deleting templates
- And more. For full details, see [the PR description](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67125)

## Testing Instructions

1. Install and activate the [Gutenberg Nightly plugin](https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/#nightly) from Gutenberg Times, or use [this Playground link](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/playnightly.json)
2. Navigate to Site Editor > Templates and test the new template management features
3. Verify that you can see template categories for Active, Custom, and theme templates.
4. Test custom theme templates
1. Create, edit, and save a custom theme template, and confirm it only appears in the Custom templates list.
5. Test active templates
1. Create multiple templates for the same target slug (ie, single-post) and ensure you can activate/deactivate different templates, and that the front-end rendering uses the correct template.
2. Confirm that when activating one template, the other templates for that slug are marked as inactive.
3. Test that you can activate a template in the template editing view.
6. Test default template fallback
1. Deactivate a theme template and ensure the correct fallback template (in line with the template hierarchy) is used instead.
7. Test switching themes
1. Once you’ve created a custom template, switch to a different block theme and ensure the custom template remains.
8. Test that template revisions, duplicating templates, and deleting templates work as expected.

## Testing Steps

## Breaking Changes

- Changes to `getEditedPostId` and `getCurrentPostId` may impact plugins
- Plugins should migrate to use `getEditedPostSlug` instead
