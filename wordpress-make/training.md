## Recent Updates and Achievements

## Announcement

We’re considering issuing certificates specifically for course cohort students. Unlike automated course completion certificates—which can sometimes be misused—cohorts are different. In a cohort, students must actively participate in regular classes, complete assessments, and pass an exam before earning a certificate.

## **News**

### **Meeting Note Takers**

- 7 Oct – [@sonaliprajapati](https://profiles.wordpress.org/sonaliprajapati/)
- 14 Oct  – [@jaydipgoswami](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jaydipgoswami/)
- 21 Oct – [@hemant-ahir](https://profiles.wordpress.org/hemant-ahir/)
- 28 Oct – [@mosescursor](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mosescursor/)

### **Looking for feedback**

- The current use of machine-generated transcripts for lessons often leads to unclear content. Since YouTube provides transcription, we plan to shift to high-quality, human-curated text directly tied to each lesson. This change is a priority based on feedback from the disability community regarding accessibility issues with translated transcripts. If video producers can’t create the text themselves, others may assist. Share suggestions or help test new formats in the Training Team Slack or GitHub discussions.

### **Looking for volunteers**

- We’re reviewing the following courses for errors, broken links, and outdated content. Help by reporting issues on GitHub:

  - Even small contributions make a big difference in improving the learner experience on [Learn.WordPress.org](https://learn.wordpress.org/).
- Looking for Ideas: Learn Pathways 2.0 – Localized Learning Experience
  - We’re exploring how to make Learning Pathways more relevant across regions and languages, and we’d love your ideas!
- As we prepare for the next phase of [Learn.WordPress.org](https://learn.wordpress.org/), we want to understand:

  - How can we adapt learning paths to reflect local WordPress communities and examples?
  - What types of content help you learn best in your native language — short videos, written guides, or quizzes?
  - How can we ensure translated content feels natural and culturally appropriate?

Please share your thoughts in the Training Team Slack channel or on GitHub. Your insights will help shape the next generation of Learn.WordPress experiences and ensures that learning WordPress feels personal and accessible to everyone — wherever they are in the world.

**Looking for feedback**

The content translation process in the Training Team could use some improvement. Currently, our lessons rely on transcripts as their main written content. However, these machine-generated transcripts are often difficult to understand. We originally included them to ensure there was at least some content alongside the video, which could then be translated into different languages.

**Looking for volunteers**

Several courses are listed in the WordPress Credit course, so we’ve decided to review them thoroughly. Our goal is to catch and fix any misspellings, typos, broken links, or outdated information.

**Update for last weeks triage squad**

No meeting last week.

**Other news**

- The “WordPress Block Editor Basics” course cohort has concluded. If you have any proposals for making the future cohorts better, please say it loud and clear! Every voice counts. [Follow this link](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RW657Q/p1759071817824989) or ask [@rfluethi](https://profiles.wordpress.org/rfluethi/) how to get involved.

## **Quick summary**

Our cohort showed this: interest in the Block Editor is high, recordings help — but they don’t replace live energy. Going forward, we’ll focus more on short tasks with feedback, clear guidance upfront, regional times/languages, and inviting via Meetup. Less lecture, more hands‑on.

## **What it was about**?

At the end of 2024, Lax Mariappan [@lakshmananphp](https://profiles.wordpress.org/lakshmananphp/) and Jonathan Bossenger [@psykro](https://profiles.wordpress.org/psykro/) ran a successful cohort based on the Beginner Developer Learning Pathway. We’re building on that: the focus is practical learning and confident use of the Block Editor.

Led by Muhibul Haque [@devmuhib](https://profiles.wordpress.org/devmuhib/), we kicked off a “Block Editor Basics” cohort — as a complement to Learn WordPress and with a train‑the‑trainer mindset: participants should use the Block Editor confidently and be able to host their own workshops or cohorts. In six weekly online sessions (60–90 minutes), we covered layout blocks, Patterns, the Site Editor, and Templates — with demos, exercises, and Q&A. On 28 Sep 2025, a shared retrospective wrapped up the cohort.

## **How the cohort went**?

[@bigod](https://profiles.wordpress.org/bigod/), [@Chris Ober](https://profiles.wordpress.org/chris1ober/), [@dilip2615](https://profiles.wordpress.org/dilip2615/), [@gcordner](https://profiles.wordpress.org/gcordner/), [@mosescursor](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mosescursor/), [@dparthj](https://profiles.wordpress.org/dparthj/), [@rahmatgumilar](https://profiles.wordpress.org/rahmatgumilar/), [@talha74](https://profiles.wordpress.org/talha74/), [@tuba121](https://profiles.wordpress.org/tuba121/), [@vasantrajput](https://profiles.wordpress.org/vasantrajput/)

### **Topics across six sessions**

Basics & layout (Group/Row/Stack/Grid), Columns & Cover, List/Gallery/Code, Managing Patterns, Site Editor & Templates/Template Parts, Tables & Shortcodes, plus best practices/theme blocks.

## **What worked well**?

- Recordings helped those who missed sessions keep up and provide material for future lessons/workshops.
- There’s clear interest in advanced topics. An optional advanced track (e.g., REST API, block/theme development, debugging, performance) makes sense.
- Small‑group work, focused Q&A blocks, and short tasks raised engagement without taking over the whole slot.
- Learning pathways give orientation and can improve completion rates.

## **Where it was bumpy**?

- Time slot: 13:00 UTC meant 20:00 in Indonesia and 06:00 in the US — tough on a Sunday.
- Reach: announced only in Slack; the term “cohort” is confusing for some.
- Format: sometimes too passive. Some felt live tasks slowed things down, others wanted exactly that. PDFs without direct task ties were used less.
- Interaction: no shared space (instead of DMs) — the group dynamic suffered.
- Content: unclear whether “Classic vs Block Themes” is really needed.
- Recordings sometimes reduced the motivation to join live (“I’ll watch later”).
- Recordings: how we handle them afterward was open.

From these learnings, we’re making four concrete, immediately actionable changes.

## **What we’re changing now**?

### **Communication and participation**

- Kick‑off via Meetup.com with prerequisites, flow, and time commitment before sign‑up. After that, the cohort is closed.
- Make time commitment transparent: 60–90 min live weekly plus 30–60 min tasks.
- Offer regional cohorts in local times and languages to better address language barriers and time zones.
- We’ll clarify recordings before the start and explain in the kick‑off how we’ll handle them.
- Consider highlight clips (5–10 min) instead of full replays to keep live sessions valuable — but note this requires significant additional moderation effort.

### **Teaching approach**

- Shorter follow‑along tasks with feedback right after demos.
- Core tasks as homework with clear submissions and checks.
- Small‑group phases and focused Q&A for more activation.
- A project running across the series: developed as homework, presented to the group at the end.
- Level‑tasks: simple live tasks plus optional advanced homework — so both beginners and fast learners benefit.
- Spotlight moments in live sessions where participants share progress.

### **Content**

- Gather prerequisites and needs upfront (incl. “Classic vs Block Themes”) and make them transparent in the kick‑off.
- Easy‑to‑follow examples to build — live or as homework. Optional advanced track in small groups.

### **Community and recognition**

- A shared space just for the group between sessions is essential for momentum and learning success. A DM channel isn’t suitable.
- Try badges/certificates (e.g., ≥ 80% attendance + project completion) for more commitment.
- Add spotlight moments in live sessions where participants share progress. Recognition motivates — knowing you might be “in the spotlight” increases homework completion.
- Surface real, varied participant examples (beyond trainer demos) to broaden perspectives and reinforce learning.

## **Thanks and what’s next**?

Thanks to all participants and contributors. We’ll continue the cohort in a more hands‑on, interactive, and language‑accessible way, with clear tasks, follow‑along moments, and better reach. Want to host a local cohort? Get in touch — we’ll help with the setup.

Thank you, Muhibul Haque [@devmuhib](https://profiles.wordpress.org/devmuhib/) and Rico F. Lüthi [@rfluethi](https://profiles.wordpress.org/rfluethi/) for this Cohort

### Looking for feedback

- We’re moving forward with issuing certificates for course cohort students. Unlike automated completion certificates, these will require active class participation, assessments, and passing an exam. Feedback is welcome to help refine the process (see [#3247](https://github.com/WordPress/Learn/issues/3247) for details).
- We had an interesting discussion on general learning methods, the current state of the platform, and proposals. Join the conversation and share your thoughts (see [#3278](https://github.com/WordPress/Learn/issues/3278) for details).

## Looking for volunteers

- Plans are underway to organize local workshops to make sessions more engaging. Both new and experienced speakers are welcome to participate, and co-hosting with seasoned presenters is also encouraged. Here are links for the last meeting for more information: [Slack Log](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RW657Q/p1758007242892299).
- We already have strong interest in the upcoming workshops, with 10 participants showing interest. Thanks to everyone who signed up!
