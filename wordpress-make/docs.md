## Live onboarding sessions

We recorded onboarding sessions for everyone interested in getting started with the Documentation team. We know that our “Getting started” documentation is out of date and getting involved can be very confusing and frustrating so we hope to ease the process with these sessions.

[@milana\_cap](https://profiles.wordpress.org/milana_cap/) was there a recording of the “Developer documentation – Themes handbook” presentation? I checked [on WP.tv and did not see anything](https://wordpress.tv/tag/documentation-team/).

The Documentation team’s leadership has asked Jenni McKinnon to step away from the team.

Recent changes in the structure of the WordPress release squad started a discussion about [the role of the Documentation team in documenting the release](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2025/09/10/docs-team-participation-in-wordpress-releases/). While the team was working with the Core team, the release squad, and Mary Hubbard to find a solution for this and future releases, Jenni posted comments that were out of alignment with the team, including calls for broad changes across the project and requests to remove certain members from leadership roles.

This ran counter to the Documentation team’s intentions. Docs leadership reached out privately in an effort to de-escalate the situation and asked Jenni to stop posting such comments, but this behaviour did not stop. As a result, the team has decided to ask her to step away for a period of time to reassess her involvement. We will work with her to explore rejoining the team in the future, if it aligns with the best outcomes for both her and the team.

As a team, we apologise to the community and to the individuals mentioned for any inconvenience these comments have caused. These do not reflect the views of the Documentation team, and we are committed to ensuring that they are not perceived as such.

The Documentation team reps: [@kenshino](https://profiles.wordpress.org/kenshino/), [@atachibana](https://profiles.wordpress.org/atachibana/), and [@milana\_cap](https://profiles.wordpress.org/milana_cap/).

Hi everyone,

Out of an abundance of caution, and in line with my legal and professional obligations, I want to reiterate that I have requested a full pause on any public or procedural actions regarding my status within the Docs Team—including but not limited to announcements, summaries, or agenda items—until formal proceedings have concluded.

As stated previously, I am following required legal processes, and this matter has already been escalated appropriately. Any further action taken without adherence to those processes could result in procedural, reputational, or legal consequences beyond the scope of the team.

For the sake of transparency, safety, and procedural integrity, I ask that all team-related actions that directly or indirectly involve this matter be held until the investigation and documentation are complete. I will share updates through proper channels once it is appropriate to do so.

Thank you for respecting due process and for your continued dedication to open source values.

— Jenni

## Open Floor

[@milana\_cap](https://profiles.wordpress.org/milana_cap/) and [@estelaris](https://profiles.wordpress.org/estelaris/) attended the [#core meeting](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1757516446580029) on September 10 and our conclusion is that core team wasn’t aware of the tasks of the docs team during a release. For 6.9 release, [@estelaris](https://profiles.wordpress.org/estelaris/) accepted a temporary Docs Liaison, to not interfere with release work and to have a proposal from the docs team on how we want to collaborate in future releases.

The Docs Liaison will attend the release team meetings in the [#6.9 release leads](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/6-9-release-leads) channel, review the roadmap to create the 6.9-related user documentation and to support the team during the final release day. DevNotes will be the responsibility of core committers, the [6.9 GH project](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/262) has been created to track both DevNotes and User documentation.

[@estelaris](https://profiles.wordpress.org/estelaris/) will work with the 6.9 release team on final release day to create/update the release documentation. In order to mentor other documentarians on this workflow, during the next Contributor Day (September 23), docs will have a mentoring session on this topic and record videos to add to the handbook page [Documentation process during a major version release day](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/workflows/documentation-process-during-a-major-version-release/).

Other topic discussed was how [#docs](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/tag/docs/) team gives props to contributors and we agreed to review our process on this topic.

As a summary, the team committed to discuss the following in the next discussion meeting on September 30:

- Gather all the release-related documentation (from core & docs handbooks) and review the sections that are pertinent to docs. Update what’s needed, change the vocabulary/tone and length. We know people don’t read and sometimes handbooks are written in a difficult English.
- Create a proposal of how docs wants to work in future releases ( [@estelaris](https://profiles.wordpress.org/estelaris/) to write a draft), including tasks and timing.
- Define which contributors tasks should be recognized (is there an automatization we can add to GH/WP?)  eg. when they submit an issue, submit drafts, publish a new article, etc.
- Decide what goes for noteworthy and what goes for “regular” release contributor.

### Among other handbook workflows we need to review:

- Define team members vs team contributors
- Update the team page
- Documentation team profile badge
- Add props and ask for peer reviews on meeting notes

### Gathering the list of updated files

Thank you to [@sirlouen](https://profiles.wordpress.org/sirlouen/) for [showing us](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4WU5/p1758036685793599) how to gather the updated files list during a release cycle.

_Props to_ [@milana\_cap](https://profiles.wordpress.org/milana_cap/) _and_ [@ninianepress](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ninianepress/) _for reviewing the notes_

The Documentation Team holds an [online, monthly Contributor Day](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2023/04/25/monthly-online-docs-team-contributor-day-starts-april-2023/) on the fourth Tuesday of every month. Any one may join who wishes to contribute to the team and who follows the [Code of Conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/).

## The next Docs Team Contributor Day

The next monthly online Docs Team Contributor Day will be:

**When**: [Tuesday, September 23, 2025 at 10:00 AM EDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250923T1400) for 3 hours.

**Where**: [#docs](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/docs/) channel on [Slack](http://www.slack.com/), and on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/pkq-dkqj-opm).

## To all contributors

To every contributor and attendee: Thank you. We’re so grateful for your time, care, and dedication. Cookies 🍪🍪🍪 and kudos all around! While no token of appreciation could ever match the depth of your impact on the WordPress project and our community, we hope you know just how seen, valued, and celebrated you truly are – even when words fall short.

We may not be able to thank you _enough_ today – but maybe one day we can, because we’re part of an incredible community that _can_ make it happen. Whatever “it” is, we’ll do it. Together.

## Open floor

[@estelaris](https://profiles.wordpress.org/estelaris/) shared these updates about the next release, which was discussed:

1. “Core is experimenting with a smaller release team to avoid pitfalls. The experiment will be re-evaluated after this release.
2. There seems to be no need to have docs team as a named lead in releases, I argued the importance that it has to us, mainly we want to mentor other contributors and releases are like an “extra” benefit for the team.
3. Also, the release team needs to plan better so they can ask us for someone to update the HelpHub pages – known to us as the [WP version pages](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-versions/)

For releases, Mary recommended that we name a **Docs Liaison** person that will commit to update in documentation anything related to the releases (User documentation, WP version pages, etc.).

Docs will not be in charge of wrangling/writing any **DevHub** articles related to releases. Updating issues that are posted in the Docs Issue Tracker is still on the balance, as I found out that many core committers had no clue that issues were reported to us, so they don’t update anything util someone from docs reports the issue on Trac.

And the biggest issue that we need to decide is the updating of the WP version pages. The last 3 minor releases, I have done it. 1 time I was asked when the release was being planned and the other 2 times, at the last minute. So I mentioned that we need to plan better and find a way to work together and create a process that works for both teams.

The response from core is that we give access to all core committers so they can update the WordPress version pages, that is a list of [40 people](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e6hfydL-JtRp2uQEPCJmq3Eh31VZLS65eAeAqCUXq9E/edit?usp=sharing). And I said I wasn’t comfortable in giving access to everyone, perhaps a few, my reasons the version pages are in the same site as the rest of the documentation and the docs team is in charge of maintaining the version pages also. Giving access to everyone, means we will be called less and less to help on releases or anything else.

Here is the [chat to the main conversation](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1756914956446299).”

The release team is experimenting with a smaller team with the goal to reduce the overhead on the Release Squad.

” This streamlined structure places more emphasis on collaboration with the various [Make Team Reps](https://make.wordpress.org/updates/team-reps/), who are encouraged to help coordinate efforts from within their respective teams.  The goal is to reduce the overhead on the Release Squad while still ensuring each team’s contributions and priorities are represented throughout the cycle.” as explained in the [Announcement the WordPress 6.9 Release Squad](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/08/19/announcing-the-wordpress-6-9-release-squad/)

The release team does not include representation from the documentation team. Why is this a problem? Because often documentation gets overlooked in release planning and project-wide coordination: **Documentation is not a “nice-to-have,” it is a survival requirement.** It’s not something we _might_ do if someone has time; it’s something we _must_ do — or the whole thing breaks down at scale. Removing the role from the release squad, we are not just sending the message that documentation is not important, we are showing new contributors that working on docs will never get them to the top of the credits page, therefore showing that we don’t even appreciate contributing to the Docs.

To support the smaller release team experiment, we agreed with [@4thhubbard](https://profiles.wordpress.org/4thhubbard/) to compromise on having a [Docs Liaison](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1756914956446299) for this release. But this needs to be rethought on every release. Docs needs a structure/inclusion in future releases which should be a lead.

The feedback from the docs team so far on the experiment is the lack of communication from the release team and the perception that Releases are only open to core team members.

For now, we will not give access to the docs site to core committers who are not members of the docs team. [@audrasjb](https://profiles.wordpress.org/audrasjb/) [@desrosj](https://profiles.wordpress.org/desrosj/) [@jeffpaul](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jeffpaul/) [@johnbillion](https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnbillion/) [@peterwilsoncc](https://profiles.wordpress.org/peterwilsoncc/) [@poena](https://profiles.wordpress.org/poena/) and [@sergeybiryukov](https://profiles.wordpress.org/sergeybiryukov/) currently have access and this will not be revoked. We can revisit this discussion after the experiment of a reduced release squad.

## Why is important to have a release docs lead

The documentation team maintains the [user documentation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/), including the [WordPress version](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-versions/) pages and parts of the [developer documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/).

For short, not everyone is willing to understand and follow thru with the full process and pages remain incomplete, like [this](https://wordpress.org/documentation/wordpress-version/version-6-2-3/) or [this](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/235/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=101780534).

## Documentation team lead role in past releases

In past releases, the documentation team lead has been given to anyone that asks for, even when they are not members of the documentation team. The results have been a mix of good and bad. There are two reasons, one is because of the misunderstanding of what the role is; and two, because the contributor chosen is not a member of the team thus they are unfamiliar with documentation.

Since 6.8, we have worked on updating sections in the core handbook related to documentation. Yet, the Role of the Documentation team lead is incomplete. Beginning with the [Documentation Wrangling](http://documentation%20team%20lead%20role%20in%20past%20releases/) title, “wrangling” should not be on the title as it reads like the team only “wrangles” dev docs. It is also missing reference to the user documentation, whether is updating old articles or writing new ones for new released features.

## The actual documentation process

This is a summary, the articles are linked for further explanation.

1. Open a project in GitHub – Documentation Issue Tracker, [example from 6.8](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/235)
   - In this project, DevNotes and User docs are tracked.
   - DevNotes are written by core committers or whoever has been involved in a feature. User docs are written by the docs team members.
   - Who creates the lists? DevNotes list is created by either the release tech lead or the release docs lead. User docs list is written by the release docs lead.
   - Both DevNotes and User docs should be written during the release cycle. Although, there is never enough time and both lists can be incomplete by the end of the release cycle. Docs team continues working on user docs. Any missing devnote is only updated if requested.
2. Before and on release day of a major version, other items need to be updated by the release docs lead. Full description on the [Documentation process during a major version release](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/workflows/documentation-process-during-a-major-version-release/) article in the documentation handbook. The publishing of the pages has an order that is explained in the [core handbook – releasing major versions.](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/releasing-major-versions/)
   - HelpHub or [Version release](https://wordpress.org/documentation/wordpress-version/version-6-8/) page is created.
   - [WordPress Versions](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-versions/) page is updated.
   - [Roadmap](https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/) page is updated.
   - [History](https://wordpress.org/about/history/) page is updated.
   - [Learn about WordPress origins and version history](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/learn-about-wordpress-and-version-history/) page is updated.

For **minor releases**, only the HelpHub or [Version release](https://wordpress.org/documentation/wordpress-version/version-6-8/) page is created and the [WordPress Versions](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-versions/) page gets updated.

## After the release cycle ends

When the release cycle ends, the docs team focuses on updating or writing new user documentation articles. The work is tracked in the [GH documentation issue tracker](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues) for both, user docs and developer docs.

_Props to [@milana\_cap](https://profiles.wordpress.org/milana_cap/), [@ninianepress](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ninianepress/) and [@4thhubbard](https://profiles.wordpress.org/4thhubbard/) for their feedback and review of this post._

[@estelaris](https://profiles.wordpress.org/estelaris/) first off, thanks for publishing this (and cross-posting to make/core! Its much easier for me to consume a make post than trying to track a conversation across various Slack threads.

Secondly, so that I can try and help identify ways that I (or others across the project) could help, will you verify that the following attempt to re-state the problems that I’m hearing to ensure I’m “on the right page”?

1\. The Docs team isn’t systematically include in a Release Squad

2\. The scope, authority, and responsibilities of the Docs Team Rep role (or is it the Docs release squad responsibilities) are poorly defined

3\. Docs team contributors feel undervalued, hurting morale and retention

4\. There are too few Docs team contributors, and those that are active are carrying too much load

Do those sound accurate and complete to what you’re articulating in this post?

- [Login to Reply](https://login.wordpress.org/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fmake.wordpress.org%2Fdocs%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fdocs-team-participation-in-wordpress-releases%2F%23comment-40562&locale=en_US)

Replying to your questions:

1\. Docs team was included in the Release Squad until 6.8 when it was removed, along with other teams, as part of the smaller squad experiment.

2\. For now, the scope, authority and responsibilities of both the team reps and the release docs lead are well refined, except for one section in the core handbook about roles for the docs team that needs a few updates (see below)

3\. IMO new contributors are having issues finding their place in documentation, this could be because they don’t have the skills needed or they want to make a quick contribution and be recognized for it (the badge-hunters).

4\. Yes and no, the number of contributors increases in waves depending on the releases or any special projects we may have going. The ones that stay longer, we often feel burned out and have to take breaks.

Now, none of these items are what is being articulated in this post. The post is about having representation in the Release Squad, on being part from the beginning, to be part of the planning and not be the afterthought like asking someone to update few pages on release day. During a release cycle, docs team responsibilities begin long before release day, basically as soon as the Roadmap is available.

[@jeffpaul](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jeffpaul/) we are looking at two major problems here: the work (documentation being done) and representation.

## The work

Prior to 5.8, the Documentation team’s work had nothing to do with releases. Docs focus leads in releases were entirely unknown to the Documentation team, and they never even communicated with us. This resulted in a couple of problems:

- the Documentation team didn’t have a clear priority of the work (on top of our other problems with tooling, workflows, and collaboration on various projects), and

- The Support team had a lot of extra work with every new release when users started opening tickets and asking questions, to which answers should have been in the end-user documentation.


In 5.8, I was the first Docs focus lead from the Documentation team, and I made sure that the team got regular updates about the release cycle at our weekly meetings. This raised interest in contributors to help out in learning the process and document release changes. Since then, we tried different workflows and fine-tuned the process, with the idea that, at one point, anyone can take over and be Docs focus lead, while automation, workflows and tools will make sure the Docs team stays involved the same.

Prior to 5.8, release docs was managed in a single Google spreadsheet. By 6.7, we had [GitHub project template](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/223) that was automatically populated with issues from [our repo](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues) based on the version label. We were monitoring both GitHub (Gutenberg) and Trac issues, adding them to release project, filtering by developer and end-user documentation, as well as priority. Sometime, along the way, the Training team started using that same project for shared tracking updates they needed to do in their lessons and courses.

Every second meeting of the month, we have a triage session where we discuss these issues, and every fourth meeting of the month, we have 3 hours long online Contributor Day to work on these issues. Also, whenever a Docs team member is at in-person Contributor Day during the release cycle, we made sure that person lead the Docs table there and work on these issues.

I repeat, the intention here was to create a process that CAN be lead by anyone outside of the Documentation team, not to lock the knowledge inside the team and pretend that no one else can do it. My personal top priority as an open-source contributor, has always been to enable others to replace me, and it will remain as long as I’m contributing to the open source.

By removing the Docs focus lead role from release squad, we, the Documentation team, have a fear that this process and effort will die, and that communication from the release sqaud will go back to almost non-existent. **Release 6.8 was like that and we have every reason to believe it will remain in the future as well.**

## The representation

This has been discussed in detail at [the meeting yesterday](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1757516446580029), so I’m not going to expand on it too much here. I’d like to emphasise things I already said in the meeting, that are the most important to me.

> We had people interested in learning only how to document release. Some of them would stay for other docs tasks as well.
>
> So, yes, this was a big thing for some.
>
> I think, for every new contributor, it is impotant for them to feel valued and like they did something important. People were sharing that Credits page all over the internet and were more than happy to stay in Docs team after seeing their name there.

> If there’s a role, people see the goal to reach. But also, if there’s a role, people can see that what they are doing is important.

This approach isn’t in line with genuine open-source values — it’s exclusionary and risks reinforcing harmful, cult-like behaviors.

By removing the Docs Team from the release squad under the guise of “reducing overhead,” this message sends a stark signal: documentation is not essential. That’s not just unfair — it actively erodes the foundations of transparency, contributor morale, and equitable participation.

A truly open-source process doesn’t streamline teams by making critical stakeholders invisible. It makes space at the table for every role that sustains and empowers the project — especially Docs, without which the software collapses under its own complexity.

This isn’t a neutral experiment. It’s an ethical one.

Documentation is not a convenience—it is infrastructure.

And cutting it loose for “efficiency” is neither respectful to contributors nor honest to users.

If we’re committed to a healthy project, Docs must have leadership representation — actual decision-making presence — in every release. Anything less risks repeating patterns that exclude, alienate, and diminish.

[@ninianepress](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ninianepress/) I know that coming out of today’s core devchat that [@estelaris](https://profiles.wordpress.org/estelaris/) is going to add more context to the [role of documentation in a major release team](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/wordpress-release-team-and-focus-leads/#documentation-wrangling) so perhaps there’s something not yet defined there that’s coming, but my reading of the existing responsibilities is more in ensuring certain aspects of documentation happen during a release and not with “actual decision-making presence”. Are there things that are not yet defined in that release team responsibility that relate to decision-making that you feel the Docs team should (or already is) owning? That missing context would certainly help me figure out what I can do to better support the Docs team.

TL;DR: Because WordPress powers ~43% of all websites, “good enough later” documentation isn’t an option—it’s critical infrastructure. For 6.9 and beyond, please pause the “reduced squad” experiment as it applies to Docs and immediately restore a named Docs Lead as a release‑critical role (not just a liaison), with a minimum staffing commitment equivalent to ≥3 full‑time contributors across the cycle. Also adopt release gates so features don’t ship without both developer notes and user docs milestones met. Sources and concrete steps below. ￼

1) Why this is urgent and not a “nice‑to‑have”

• Scale of impact: WordPress is used by ~43.3% of all websites. When user documentation lags, we create avoidable support load, adoption friction, and reputation risk at global scale. Documentation is part of the product, not marketing collateral.

• Project policy already acknowledges this: The Docs handbook lists a long sequence of release‑day deliverables (Version page, Versions, Roadmap, History, etc.) handled by the Release Documentation Lead(s). These are time‑critical and interdependent with Core’s “Releasing Major Versions” workflow and the [Field Guide/Dev Notes process](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/workflows/documentation-process-during-a-major-version-release/). If they slip, the whole release experience degrades.

• Research on open source sustainability shows that [relying on under‑resourced documentation and invisible maintenance work is a known failure mode](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/). Eghbal’s Roads and Bridges warns that critical public‑good software fails not from code alone, but from lack of sustained institutional support for the “unseen labor.” Docs is classic unseen labor.

2) The “reduced squad” experiment, as applied to Docs, introduces preventable risk

• The [6.9 squad announcement](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/08/19/announcing-the-wordpress-6-9-release-squad/) explicitly shifted emphasis to collaboration with team reps and fewer named roles. In practice, this dilutes responsibility for Docs at exactly the moment coordinated action is needed. Role ambiguity is repeatedly shown to [depress performance and satisfaction](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/1551874.pdf)— [especially in volunteer settings](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/nml.21602).

• The Docs team’s post here documents the real work and the gaps that appear when timing, ownership, and access aren’t clear. We should treat this as a production incident report: the pattern is predictable and fixable.

3) What “release‑ready documentation” actually includes (minimum surface)

From the Docs handbook and Core handbooks, a non‑exhaustive critical path:

Before RC: identify all items needing Dev Notes; confirm ownership; draft and peer review; prepare Field Guide content; open and track user docs issues across DevHub/HelpHub; align with Learn/Training where applicable. Release day & immediately after: publish Version page; update Versions/Roadmap/History pages; verify cross‑links; confirm translations kickoffs; reconcile any last‑minute changes from Core and Editor. These are defined, time‑bound tasks with product impact.

Relevant links:

1\. [Publishing the Field Guide](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/publishing-the-field-guide/)

2\. [Documentation process during a major release version](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/workflows/documentation-process-during-a-major-version-release/)

3\. [Releasing Major Versions](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/releasing-major-versions/)

4) Staffing reality: why ≥3 FTE‑equivalents per major release is a conservative floor

Based on the enumerated scope above (Dev Notes + Field Guide editing + user docs drafting/review + site updates + cross‑team coordination and translations), a single full‑time person cannot meet the deadline‑sensitive workload without burnout or quality regressions. A sustainable minimum looks like:

• Docs Lead / Managing Editor (coordination, checklists, RC/launch orchestration, Field Guide consolidation, final sign‑offs).

• Developer Docs Editor (Dev Notes reviews, Field Guide integration, cross‑checking with committers/tech leads).

• User Docs Writer/Editor (HelpHub, versions page, “what changed” pages, screenshots, IA tidy‑up).

This mirrors mature projects that make docs release‑blocking with [dedicated subteams](https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2022/08/11/enhancing-kubernetes-one-kep-at-a-time/); for example, Kubernetes runs each release with an explicit Docs subteam and requires [release notes](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/release-notes/) and [feature documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/new-content/new-features/) PRs as part of the gate to merge user‑visible changes. WordPress can adopt the same guardrails.

5) Proposed policy changes for 6.9 (immediately actionable)

1\. Restore all named Docs Leads for 6.9 and treat Docs as a release‑blocking function (not merely a liaison). Publish this in the squad post and the Core/Docs handbooks so ownership is unambiguous.

2\. Adopt release gates:

• No RC1 until: (a) all required Dev Notes are drafted and in peer review, (b) Field Guide has a complete first draft, (c) user‑facing docs issues are filed and assigned.

3\. Codify “Definition of Done” for features: landing a user‑visible change in Core or Gutenberg that requires docs must include either (a) a linked Dev Note draft or (b) a linked user‑docs issue + owner. Add a “needs‑user‑docs”/“needs‑dev‑note” trigger that opens the corresponding Docs tracker issue automatically.

4\. Access with guardrails: keep HelpHub publish rights in Docs for quality control; give “Author” access to vetted committers for drafts; require Docs review before publish—consistent with Make/Core Post & Comment peer‑review guidance.

5\. Sponsor commitments: ask Five‑for‑the‑Future orgs (including hosts and agencies) to pledge time explicitly to Docs during release windows. This aligns with [Roads and Bridges recommendations to institutionally support critical maintenance work](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/).

6\. Handbook updates: link the Docs “Major Release Process” directly from the Core “Releasing Major Versions” and “Release Team and Focus Leads” pages; make the Docs Lead role and deliverables unmissable for coordinators and tech leads.

7\. Community norms reminder: Discussions about scope, access, and timelines should follow the project’s Code of Conduct and Make/Core’s Post & Comment Guidelines—firm on standards, respectful to people.

6) Why this is also about contributor health (and retention)

[The data is clear](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/1551874.pdf) from [multiple studies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/nml.21602): Volunteer‑heavy teams under role ambiguity and deadline pressure predictably show burnout and attrition. The job‑demands/resources literature and meta‑analyses are clear: role ambiguity and high demands without commensurate resources correlate with exhaustion and lower performance; organizational support and clear ownership buffer those effects. If we want to recruit and keep Docs contributors, the process must reflect that science.

**Request**: For 6.9, please (a) restore all named Docs Leads as release‑critical, (b) adopt the release gates above, and (c) secure ≥3 FTE‑equivalents (or a clearly scheduled rotation that adds up to that) across the cycle. We can revisit the experiment after these safeguards and staffing are in place.

Respectfully submitted, with thanks to everyone who keeps doing the invisible work that makes releases usable.

There are three things to update in the section of the role of documentation mentioned above:

1\. Remove the “wrangling from the title.

2\. Add a paragraph that talks about the user documentation (update/create articles).

3\. Update the tasks about the dev documentation and I will leave that update to [@milana\_cap](https://profiles.wordpress.org/milana_cap/) as she understands better how to update developer documentation.

While this post may appear collaborative on the surface, it’s important to state for the record — under Chatham House Rule, and in protection of those who have been directly impacted — that this proposal was pushed forward by Mary Hubbard, despite every Docs Team lead, and multiple long-time contributors, expressing concerns about the ethics, sustainability, and power dynamics involved.

Framing this as “streamlining” or “experimenting” is misleading. What’s happening is a shift toward top-down control and exclusion, and it has already resulted in real harm, including abusive behavior behind the scenes.

This is not how open source works.

This is not how trust is built.

This is not what WordPress claims to stand for.

The Docs Team is not an accessory to Core. It is not a “nice-to-have.” It is not a team to be tokenized for credit placement while being denied participation in actual project shaping. That is not inclusion — it’s performative visibility.

No one should be erased for speaking up.

No team should be written out of releases in the name of efficiency.

And no “experimental direction” should be allowed to proceed without full, informed consent from the contributors it directly affects.

We’re watching. We are many. And we care deeply about the health and ethics of this project.

Let’s not mistake silence for agreement.

I write this with full awareness of the responsibility we each hold in open source — not only to produce good software, but to ensure safe participation for every contributor. It’s in that spirit — and to protect against further private retaliation — that I share this publicly, under Chatham House Rule.

The individual behind this proposed direction — _Mary Hubbard_ — has exhibited a documented pattern of **unethical leadership, exclusionary decision-making, and emotionally abusive behavior** toward contributors who expressed legitimate concerns. While this proposal is written in neutral language, it was not produced through a healthy or inclusive process. It reflects a pattern of coercive behavior that continues to harm contributors behind closed doors.

Multiple long-standing contributors, including team leads, raised deep concerns about this “experimental” structure — not only because it sidelines the Docs Team from meaningful participation, but because it **removes ethical checks and balance** from the release process. Those concerns were repeatedly ignored, dismissed, or redirected into inaccessible backchannels, often leaving contributors isolated and silenced.

This is not simply about a flawed experiment — this is about a **complete failure of leadership accountability**.

The individual in question:

• **Minimized reports of bullying**, publicly reframing them as “tone misunderstandings”

• **Pushed this release model forward without community consent**, despite direct objection from Docs leadership

• **Attempted to redirect harm privately**, rather than taking public responsibility for addressing systemic failure

If this sounds familiar, it’s because these are **common patterns in toxic leadership environments** — and we owe it to ourselves, and each other, to name them.

**Let me be clear**: raising this publicly is not an act of aggression.

It is an act of _protection_ — for the contributors who are still here, and the ones who left silently after experiencing similar treatment. We’ve seen the private repercussions for speaking up. That is **exactly** why this must be said publicly now.

If this project is to remain healthy and sustainable, we need leadership that is **trauma-informed, collaborative, and transparently accountable** — not one that operates through optics, control, and retribution.

We are not confused.

We are not alone.

We are not going to be silent anymore.

We appreciate [@ninianepress](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ninianepress/) sharing her perspective. At the same time, the concerns raised about Mary have not been discussed with the Docs Team, and they should not be read as representing the team as a whole.

Thank you for your reply.

To clarify: I spoke with multiple contributors — both within the Docs Team and beyond — before sharing my comment. In accordance with Chatham House Rule and out of respect for those individuals’ privacy, I’m not naming names. Several contributors expressed concern about potential retaliation, which is why I chose to raise the issue publicly and transparently, rather than leaving it in private channels where similar concerns have historically gone unheard.

While it’s often recommended that issues like this be brought to the Incident Response Team, many in the community already know that this pathway has serious limitations — particularly when the person in question holds a high level of influence or leadership. We’ve seen in recent history that even well-documented concerns don’t always lead to meaningful intervention. That’s not an accusation — it’s simply a structural reality.

When formal systems lack the power to respond effectively, contributors turn to documentation and transparency as a last resort. That’s what this is.

This is not about assigning blame to individuals for the sake of it. It’s about ensuring a safer, more accountable, and more sustainable future for everyone — especially those who’ve been quietly harmed before, and deserve to see that the project is capable of growth, not just governance by optics.

[@estelaris](https://profiles.wordpress.org/estelaris/) as noted in [last week’s core devchat](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/09/10/summary-dev-chat-september-10-2025/), I’ve gone ahead and updated the core handbook on crafting the About page (and thus the credits listing) to ensure that whoever is leading the effort coordinates with Make Team Reps to capture folks not immediately named on the Release Squad for potential inclusion in the Noteworthy Contributors section (see the [“Props” section of that handbook page](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/preparing-the-about-page/#props)).
