One thing many software projects do is have a channel where their top users can interact with the developers of the software.

It’s interesting to think how that would look like for WordPress or its sub-projects. A customer channel where a subset of the folks who use it the most every day can hang out with the folks working on what they use.

Hi – are you able to share some links to good examples of open-source software projects doing this? I’d like to understand how this process works & how effective it can be.

We could grab W3Techs’ list of top domains, monitor their sitemaps/feeds, and then invite those who regularly create fresh content.

A potential issue is that these “top” customers are likely “high-value” customers, so putting them all into a semi-public Slack channel would make them targets.

Essentially, a WordPress version of a test group for the top customers/users. Provide a space for sharing ideas, giving feedback on features under development, or discussing long-term roadmap items in a quick/closed loop fashion.

WordPress already has forums, Slack channels, and contributor teams, but a more focused interaction channel for top users could improve engagement and relevance. It could also serve as a middle ground between the informal feedback channels (forums, social media) and the formalized feedback (tickets, proposals).

This ☝️!

I’m in the Automattic for Agencies program, which has been the single most impactful support for my solo developer journey since finding WordPress in 2009.

Almost all of my questions, though, revolve around ‘core’ WordPress. So a space to learn and share with others doing the same would be awesome! 😀

- [Login to Reply](https://login.wordpress.org/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fmake.wordpress.org%2Fmeta%2F2025%2F03%2F15%2Ftop-customer-channel%2F%23comment-9769&locale=en_US)

This is a fantastic discussion, and the idea of a dedicated channel for top WordPress users to interact with core developers resonates strongly. It’s a concept that could bridge a crucial gap in the current feedback ecosystem.

I appreciate the different angles presented in the comments. Neil’s question about existing examples in other open-source projects is a great starting point for research. Nicholas raises a very practical point about identifying top users via W3Techs, but more importantly, highlights the critical security concern of making high-value clients targets—any such channel would need to be private and carefully managed.

Mary and Nomad Skateboarding’s comments really get to the heart of the potential value here. Framing it as a “closed-loop test group,” as Mary suggests, perfectly captures its purpose. It’s not just another support forum; it’s a strategic feedback mechanism for roadmap items and features in development. Nomad’s experience with the Automattic for Agencies program is a powerful testament to how effective this model can be. It provides a space for deep, nuanced questions that go beyond typical user support and touch on the “core” experience.

To build on this, the definition of a “top user” should be broad. It’s not just the sites with the most traffic, but also the solo developers, small agencies, and content creators who are building complex solutions and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with the platform. This channel could offer them a direct line to share insights that are often lost in broader forums.

Ultimately, a well-curated, invitation-only group could provide the core development team with high-signal, actionable feedback, while offering power users a meaningful way to contribute to the platform’s future. It would formalize the informal connections that already exist and create a powerful engine for innovation and improvement. Building these kinds of feedback loops is central to modern software development, and it’s a challenge we’re passionate about solving at 1stContact.ai.

Over the past few months, the Meta and Design teams have collaborated on a new design for [Make WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/)—the very site where this post is published. This refresh is part of the ongoing effort to establish a consistent design language across WordPress.org. In case you missed it, the new Photos Directory was also launched earlier this week!

Congratulations to everyone who contributed to this project, and here are two quick videos that show the before and after:

As shown in the video, Make WordPress now features a new block-based homepage with a more expressive design and a standardized aesthetic across the rest of the site. A few notable highlights include a handbook template that now matches those in Developer Resources and Documentation and a redesigned meeting calendar.

[![The updated homepage design for Make WordPress.](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/meta/files/2024/12/new-home-1.png?resize=776%2C416&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/meta/files/2024/12/new-home-1.png?ssl=1) _The updated_ [_homepage_](https://make.wordpress.org/) _is built with blocks._[![The new team handbook design for Make WordPress features a three-column layout.](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/meta/files/2024/12/new-core.png?resize=776%2C416&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/meta/files/2024/12/new-core.png?ssl=1) _The new_ [_team handbook_](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/) _design features a three-column layout._[![The redesigned meeting calendar for Make WordPress improves usability.](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/meta/files/2024/12/new-calendar.png?resize=776%2C416&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/meta/files/2024/12/new-calendar.png?ssl=1) _The redesigned_ [_meeting calendar_](https://make.wordpress.org/meetings/) _improves usability._

## Next steps

This refresh was not a complete redesign. The Make section of WordPress.org is vast, covering 32 contributor teams and 114 local teams, each with its own blog, handbooks, and component pages. The primary goal was to introduce a block-based homepage, update the overall design with style improvements, and make the sites visually consistent with the rest of WordPress.org. The refresh did not fundamentally change how Make WordPress functions or address any content-related issues that might have existed prior.

Teams are encouraged to review their sections. This is a great time to update content in handbooks, team welcome messages, and more. Note that [Trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/) was not redesigned in this update and will be addressed in the future.

If you find any issues or have suggestions for additional improvements, please add a ticket to the WordPress.org [issues queue](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22%5BSite%5D%20Make%20blogs%22) on GitHub or on [Trac](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&component=Make+(Get+Involved)+%2F+P2&order=priority).

I think the homepage would look better if the bottom padding of the hero section was removed.

The circular profile images appear odd with the current spacing, as they are cut off at the bottom.

Over the past month and a half, the Meta and Design teams have been working on a new look for the [Photos Directory](https://wordpress.org/photos/). This visual refresh is part of the continued effort to establish a consistent design language across WordPress.org. I’m pleased to announce that the updated site launched today. Congratulations to everyone who contributed to this project!

Here’s a quick look at the before and after.

The Photos Directory now uses a [block child theme](https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-photo-directory) alongside the shared WordPress.org [parent theme](https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-parent-2021). This update involved converting all elements to blocks and standardizing the layout, typography, and colors. Now, all directories across WordPress.org share consistent aesthetics and functionality, which simplifies any site-wide enhancements that may be considered in the future.

[![The update homepage of the Photos Directory.](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/meta/files/2024/12/new-home.png?resize=776%2C443&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/meta/files/2024/12/new-home.png?ssl=1) _The updated_ [_homepage_](https://wordpress.org/photos/) _features a more expansive grid of photos._[![The search and filtering functionality in the refreshed Photos Directory.](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/meta/files/2024/12/search-results-detail.png?resize=776%2C443&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/meta/files/2024/12/search-results-detail.png?ssl=1) _Search and filtering are now consistent across directories on WordPress.org._[![The single photo template in the refreshed Photos Directory.](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/meta/files/2024/12/single-photo.png?resize=776%2C443&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/meta/files/2024/12/single-photo.png?ssl=1) _The_ [_single photo_](https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/174673e52b/) _template features an updated and simplified design._

## Next steps

So, now that the new Photos Directory theme is live on WordPress.org, take a look around and perhaps consider contributing a few photos of your own. At the time of writing, the directory is getting close to 20,000 photos!

If you do find any issues or have suggestions for future improvements, please add a ticket to the WordPress.org [issues queue](https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-photo-directory/issues) on GitHub or open a [discussion item](https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-photo-directory/discussions).

Thanks for the great work, everyone! This looks great.

Somewhat related to appearance but to how the images themselves are processed instead of the theme. I have [opened a meta ticket](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7460) and there is an [outstanding systems request](https://make.wordpress.org/systems/2024/02/12/imagemagick-for-photo-directory/) about switching from using GD to ImageMagick so that colors are more true to the originally uploaded photos. Just wanted to share it for awareness.

A “Random Photo” button would be very nice.

I just saw there is one at the bottom of the individual photos pages, I think this button would also have a great place on the home page of the directory.

Also if someone wants to skip through random photos they’d have to scroll down to the bottom of the page every time to get to the next random photo

Nice suggestion, thanks! Would you be able to [add this as an issue on Github](https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-photo-directory/issues)? That will put this enhancement into the queue so it’s more readily taken into account for future updates.

I took a closer look into the project for covering the announcement [https://themeisle.com/blog/wordpress-photo-directory-refresh](https://themeisle.com/blog/wordpress-photo-directory-refresh) but couldn’t easily find who the top contributors are.

A contributors page featuring those who contributed would bring some nice recognition to those who submit their images.

Are you looking for a list of those who contributed to the refresh launch or to the Photos Directory more broadly? Contributors to the Photos Directory do get the Photos badge on their profile.

It would be nice to have a dedicated page of those who contributed their photos. This could not only encourage them to keep submitting but also motivate others to contribute more 🙂

A chart would bring the top contributors better recognition, besides the badge that everyone receives.
