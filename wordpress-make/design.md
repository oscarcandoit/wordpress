## The Design Team provides design for the WordPress project.

Want to get involved? See the [handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/) and optionally drop into [#design](http://chat.wordpress.org/) to chat. Most active design work happens in [the block editor project](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/get-involved/gutenberg-contribution/), consider dropping into [Needs design](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Needs+Design%22) or [Needs design feedback](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Needs+Design+Feedback%22).

**Figma Access**

There’s a [WordPress Component Library in Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1436359662053949167/wordpress-design-system). Duplicate to edit, direct access is [reserved for the design team](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/get-involved/tools-figma/). Figma accounts are free, but [edit access is not](https://www.figma.com/pricing/).

You don’t need edit access to use the Figma libraries, you can copy components from there into your own drafts. If you’re a contributor with the ability to grant edit access, please be mindful, and downgrade to view access once the initial need for edit has waned.
