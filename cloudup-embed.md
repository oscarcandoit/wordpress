Via the Media Settings, you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

“Off:” This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position, the toggle switch is gray.

“On:” This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
