## [Custom Background Color](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-one/\#custom-background-color)

Twenty Twenty includes the option to change your site’s background color.

To change the background color, navigate to Customizer → Colors & Dark Mode.

[![A screenshot of the Customizer with the preview of the site and with the Colors & Dark Mode settings panel opened.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/TT1-Customizer-Colors.png)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/TT1-Customizer-Colors.png)

Add your own custom color, or select a color from the palette.

[![The Dark Mode option in the Customizer.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/TT1-Customizer-Color-Palettes.png)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/TT1-Customizer-Color-Palettes.png)

The colors of the elements on your site are automatically calculated based on the background colors you pick. This ensures that the color contrast is always high enough to be accessible to all visitors.

## [Site Logo](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-one/\#site-logo)

Twenty Twenty-One includes a site logo setting which can be used to display the logo of your business or an image of yourself. You can set your site logo by going to Customizer → Site Identity.

- A horizontal menu between the widget area and the footer at the bottom of the screen, which only supports one level of navigation.

## [Dark Mode Support](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-one/\#dark-mode-support)

One of the accessibility features of the Twenty Twenty-One theme is support for the visitor’s color scheme preferences in their operating system or browser’s settings. The feature is opt-in and supported in most operating systems, including [Android](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9275525?co=GENIE.Platform=Android&hl=en), [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210332), [OSX](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208976), [Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-desktop-background-and-colors-176702ca-8e24-393b-15f2-b15b38f69de6), as well as most Linux distributions.

If you have Dark Mode enabled, your site will be shown to visitors using a light or dark color scheme, respecting their operating system’s preferences. Depending on their lighting conditions or personal preferences they may choose to switch color schemes using a dedicated button on the bottom-right of their site (or bottom-left for RTL languages).

### [Enabling Dark Mode from the Customizer](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-one/\#enabling-dark-mode-from-the-customizer)

To activate Dark Mode Support, you can go to the Colors & Dark Mode section in your Customizer. If you have a light color selected for the site’s background, you will be able to see and activate the `Dark Mode Support` setting. The background color you select will be applied to light mode, while Dark Mode colors are optimized automatically. You can use the Dark Mode On/Off button at the bottom of the preview screen to toggle between dark & light schemes in your preview.

### [Dark Mode in the Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-one/\#dark-mode-in-the-editor)

The editor will by default respect your operating system’s color scheme settings. If on the front of your site you have chosen a different scheme (using the Dark Mode On/Off button), then the editor will use the preferred scheme.

[![The post editor with Dark Mode enabled. The background color is dark grey and the text is white,](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/12/TT1-Dark-Mode-Editor-scaled-1.jpg)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/12/TT1-Dark-Mode-Editor-scaled-1.jpg)
