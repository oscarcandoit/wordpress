[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

With the TikTok Embed block, you can include a TikTok video into your post/page. You don’t need a TikTok account to embed a video, although the video should be public.

If you use an URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message _“Sorry, this content could not be embedded.”_

You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or convert it to a link.

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/tiktok-embed/\#block-toolbar)

Besides the “Mover” and “Drag & Drop Handle”, the Block Toolbar for the TikTok Embed block shows four buttons:

- Transform to
- Change Alignment
- Edit URL, and
- More Options

**Transform to**

![Options to transform the TikTok block to Paragraph, Columns or Group.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/08/image12-1.png)

You can transform a TikTok embed into a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the TikTok embed.

**Change alignment**

![Alignment options for the TikTok block: wide width, full width, align left, align center, and align right.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/08/image26-1.png)

- **Align left** – Make the TikTok post left aligned.
- **Align center** – Make the TikTok post alignment centered.
- **Align right**– Make the TikTok post right aligned.
- **Wide width** – Increase the width of the post beyond the content size.
- **Full width** – Extend the TikTok post to cover the full width of the screen.

“Wide width” and “Full width” alignment need to be enabled by the Theme of your site.

**Edit URL**

Via the edit URL, you can change the TikTok Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the “Embed” button.

![Editing the block URL via the "edit" option.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/08/image27-1.png)

**More options**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/tiktok-embed/\#block-settings)

Besides the Advanced section, the TikTok embed has only one setting in the “Block Settings” sidebar: Media Settings.

**Media Settings**

![Media settings for the embed block with the toggle OFF/ON for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/pasted-image-0-15-1.png)

Via the _Media Settings,_ you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position, the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

![Additional CSS Class(es) option for the TikTok Embed block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/image-77.png)

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
