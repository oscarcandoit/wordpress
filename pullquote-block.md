[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

If you want to add emphasis to a piece of text in your post or page, the _pullquote block_ can quickly and easily make short snippets look beautiful.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/overview-pullquote-block-v5.9-1.png)Pullquotes are like blockquotes but designed to draw attention.

To add one, click the **Block Inserter** icon when editing your post or page.

You can also quickly add one by typing `/pullquote` in a blank _paragraph block_ and then hitting the enter key.

_Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)._

In this video, you can see how you can use the pullquote block and the different settings to modify how your pullquote will appear.

How pullquote block works

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pullquote-block/\#block-toolbar)

In order to reveal the block toolbar, you can click on the block and the toolbar will display.

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons and blocks specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The pullquote block shows five standard buttons:

- Transform to
- Moving handles
- Change alignment
- Text Editing options (bold, italics, add a link, and drop-down for more text editing options)
- More options

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/toolbar-pullquote-block-v5.9.png)The _pullquote block_ has alignment and text formatting options.

### [Transform to](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pullquote-block/\#transform-to)

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/transform-to-2-1024x652.png)

When you click on the “Transform” button you can convert the pullquote block into another block type, using the existing content.

You can transform the pullquote block into a “Paragraph” block, “Group” block, “Quote” block, “List” block, or “Heading” block. The “Group” would give you the ability to change the background color around the Quote.

You can also transform the style of your pullquote block

The _pullquote block_ includes two styles, ‘Default’ and ‘Solid’ color.

The ‘Default’ pullquote is a simple style that looks like this:

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/overview-pullquote-block-v5.9-1.png)Pullquote default color style

The ‘solid color’ pullquote is a little different, and looks like this:

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/solid-color-style.png)Pullquote solid color style

While it looks like a variation on the ‘Default color’ pullquote, the ‘solid color’ pullquote really shines when you use the block’s color settings to select colors.

### [Block-moving tools](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pullquote-block/\#block-moving-tools)

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/moving-handles-toolbar-pullquote-block-v5.9.png)The movement handles are displayed as 2 arrow icons.

The up and down arrow icons can be used to move a block up and down in your document.

_Detailed instructions on moving a block within the editor can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/moving-blocks/)_

### [Change alignment](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pullquote-block/\#change-alignment)

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/alignment-toolbar-pullquote-block-v5.9.png)Block toolbar with the drop-down for alignment.

You can align the _pullquote block_ itself to the left, right, and none (= center) from the toolbar. When using the left or right alignment, you can put another block beside the _pullquote block_.

The _pullquote block_ also has a Wide and Full width alignment that is useful for creating unique headers and widescreen effects. _These two options are only available if your Theme supports these alignments._

### [Text editing options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pullquote-block/\#text-editing-options)

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/text-options-toolbar-pullquote-block-v5.9.png)

**Bold and Italics**

Used quite frequently, Bold and Italics formatting have their own buttons on the Toolbar. The shortcuts are CTRL+b (or Command+B) for bold and CTRL+i (or Command+i) for italics.

**Insert Hyperlinks**

Use the chain link icon to insert a hyperlink to your highlighted text.

### [More rich text options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pullquote-block/\#more-rich-text-options)

The drop-down menu to the left of the [More options menu](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/) contains a range of additional rich text editing options such as highlighting, inline code, strikethrough, and more.

[Read about more rich text editing options.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-text-editing-overview/)

### [More options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pullquote-block/\#more-options)

The Options menu represented by three vertical dots on the far right of the toolbar gives you more features such as the ability to duplicate or remove the block.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pullquote-block/\#block-settings)

Every block has specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar. _If you do not see the sidebar, simply click the ‘cog’ icon next to the Publish button._

[![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/block-settings-4.png)](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/block-settings-2.png?ssl=1)

The block styles can also be found in the sidebar settings along with the color settings and advanced options.

### [Color](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pullquote-block/\#color)

Like the _paragraph block_, the _pullquote block_ has color selection settings in the block’s sidebar settings.

The main color option allows you to set the color of the accent lines on the top and bottom of the ‘regular’ style and changes the background color of the ‘solid color’ style.

The text color option allows you to set the color of the pullquote’s text in both styles.

For details refer to this support article: [Color settings overview](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/)

### [Typography](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pullquote-block/\#typography)

The pullqoute provides typography settings to change the font family, appearance, line height, letter spacing, decoration, letter case, and font size.

For details refer to this support article: [Typography settings overview](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/)

### [Border](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pullquote-block/\#border)

The pullqoute block provides border settings options to add border color, width, and radius.

For details refer to this support article: [Border settings overview](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/border-settings-overview/)

### [Advanced](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pullquote-block/\#advanced)

The “Advanced” tab lets you add HTML anchor and CSS class(es) to your block.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/advanced-tab-pullquote-block-v5.9.png)The “Advanced” tab lets you add HTML anchor and CSS class(es) to your block.

“HTML anchor” allows you to [make a unique web address](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-jumps/) for a particular “Video” block. Then, you’ll be able to link directly to a “Quote” block of your page.

The “Additional CSS class(es)” lets you add CSS class(es) to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
