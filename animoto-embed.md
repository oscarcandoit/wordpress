With the Animoto Embed block, you can embed your own Animoto video which you have created on your Animoto account. You need an account to create/customize your own videos and embed them into your post. A user who does not have an Animoto account can play the full video from the post.

The Animoto embed can be transformed into a group. This gives the ability to change the background color around the Animoto embed.
