# Introduction [¶](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.igbinary.php\#intro.igbinary)

Igbinary is a drop in replacement for the standard PHP serializer.
Instead of the time and space consuming textual representation used by PHP's [serialize()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.serialize.php),
igbinary stores PHP data structures in a compact binary form.
Memory savings are significant when using memcached, APCu,
or similar memory based storages for serialized data.
The typical reduction in storage requirements are around 50%.
The exact percentage depends on the data.
