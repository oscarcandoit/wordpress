# Keeping Current [¶](https://www.php.net/manual/en/security.current.php\#security.current)

PHP, like any other large system, is under constant scrutiny and
improvement. Each new version will often include both major and
minor changes to enhance security and repair any flaws, configuration
mishaps, and other issues that will affect the overall security
and stability of your system.


Like other system-level scripting languages and programs, the best
approach is to update often, and maintain awareness of the latest
versions and their changes.
