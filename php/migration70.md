Despite the fact that PHP 7.0 is a new major version, efforts have been
made to make migration as painless as possible. This release focuses
mainly on removing functionality deprecated in previous versions and
improving language consistency.


There are a [few incompatibilities](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration70.incompatible.php)
and [new features](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration70.new-features.php) that should
be considered, and code should be tested before switching PHP versions in
production environments.
