# Stream Filters [¶](https://www.php.net/manual/en/stream.filters.php\#stream.filters)

A `filter` is a final piece of code which may perform
operations on data as it is being read from or written to a stream.
Any number of filters may be stacked onto a stream. Custom
filters can be defined in a PHP script using
[stream\_filter\_register()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-filter-register.php) or in an extension.
To access the list of currently
registered filters, use [stream\_get\_filters()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-get-filters.php).
