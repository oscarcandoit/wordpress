Here we would like to show the very basics of PHP in a short, simple
tutorial. This text only deals with dynamic web page creation with
PHP, though PHP is not only capable of creating web pages. See
the section titled [What can PHP\\
do](https://www.php.net/manual/en/introduction.php#intro-whatcando) for more information.


PHP-enabled web pages are treated just like regular HTML pages and
you can create and edit them the same way you normally create
regular HTML pages.
