# List of Supported Socket Transports [¶](https://www.php.net/manual/en/transports.php\#transports)

## Table of Contents [¶](https://www.php.net/manual/en/transports.php\#transports)

- [Internet Domain: TCP, UDP, SSL, and TLS](https://www.php.net/manual/en/transports.inet.php)
- [Unix Domain: Unix and UDG](https://www.php.net/manual/en/transports.unix.php)

The following is a list of the various URL style socket transports
that PHP has built-in for use with the streams based socket
functions such as [fsockopen()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fsockopen.php), and
[stream\_socket\_client()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-socket-client.php). These transports do
_not_ apply to the
[Socket Functions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.sockets.php) of the Sockets extension.


For a list of transports installed in your version of
PHP use [stream\_get\_transports()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-get-transports.php).
