# Introduction [¶](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.swoole.php\#intro.swoole)

Swoole is a parallel network communication engine based on asynchronous event-driven and coroutine,
written in C++, providing coroutine and high-performance network programming support for PHP.
It provides various network server and client modules for multiple communication protocols, making it easy to
quickly implement TCP/UDP services, high-performance Web, WebSocket services, IoT, real-time communication, games,
microservices, etc., breaking the limits of PHP in traditional web domains.

To get started, please check the [» Swoole Docs](https://wiki.swoole.com/).
