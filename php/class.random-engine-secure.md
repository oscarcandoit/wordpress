(PHP 8 >= 8.2.0)

## Introduction [¶](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.random-engine-secure.php\#random-engine-secure.intro)

Generates cryptographically secure randomness using the operating system’s CSPRNG.


The randomness generated by this [Random\\Engine](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.random-engine.php) is suitable
for all applications, including the generation of long-term secrets, such as
encryption keys.


The **Random\\Engine\\Secure** engine is the recommended safe default choice,
unless the application requires either reproducible sequences or very high performance.
