## Error Control Operators [¶](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.errorcontrol.php\#language.operators.errorcontrol)

PHP supports one error control operator: the at sign ( `@`).
When prepended to an expression in PHP, any diagnostic error that might
be generated by that expression will be suppressed.


If a custom error handler function is set with
[set\_error\_handler()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php), it will still be called even though
the diagnostic has been suppressed.


**Warning**

Prior to PHP 8.0.0, the [error\_reporting()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php) called inside the custom error handler
always returned `0` if the error was suppressed by the `@` operator.
As of PHP 8.0.0, it returns the value of this (bitwise) expression:
`E_ERROR | E_CORE_ERROR | E_COMPILE_ERROR | E_USER_ERROR | E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR | E_PARSE`.


Any error message generated by the expression is available in the `"message"`
element of the array returned by [error\_get\_last()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.error-get-last.php).
The result of that function will change on each error, so it needs to be checked early.


**Example #1 Intentional file error**

`<?php
$my_file = @file ('non_existent_file') or
    die ("Failed opening file: error was '" . error_get_last()['message'] . "'");
?>`

Run code

**Example #2 Suppressing Expressions**

`<?php
// this works for any expression, not just functions:
$value = @$cache[$key];
// will not issue a notice if the index $key doesn't exist.
?>`

Run code

> **Note**:
>
> The `@`-operator works only on
> [expressions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.expressions.php).
> A simple rule of thumb is: if one can take the value of something,
> then one can prepend the `@` operator to it.
> For instance, it can be prepended to variables, functions calls,
> certain language construct calls (e.g. [include](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php)),
> and so forth.
> It cannot be prepended to function or class definitions,
> or conditional structures such as `if` and
> [`foreach`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php), and so forth.

**Warning**

Prior to PHP 8.0.0, it was possible for the `@` operator
to disable critical errors that will terminate script execution.
For example, prepending `@` to a call of a function
which did not exist, by being unavailable or mistyped, would cause
the script to terminate with no indication as to why.

`I was confused as to what the @ symbol actually does, and after a few experiments have concluded the following:
* the error handler that is set gets called regardless of what level the error reporting is set on, or whether the statement is preceeded with @
* it is up to the error handler to impart some meaning on the different error levels. You could make your custom error handler echo all errors, even if error reporting is set to NONE.
* so what does the @ operator do? It temporarily sets the error reporting level to 0 for that line. If that line triggers an error, the error handler will still be called, but it will be called with an error level of 0
Hope this helps someone`

`Be aware of using error control operator in statements before include() like this:
<?PHP
(@include("file.php"))
OR die("Could not find file.php!");
?>
This cause, that error reporting level is set to zero also for the included file. So if there are some errors in the included file, they will be not displayed.`

`If you're wondering what the performance impact of using the @ operator is, consider this example.  Here, the second script (using the @ operator) takes 1.75x as long to execute...almost double the time of the first script.
So while yes, there is some overhead, per iteration, we see that the @ operator added only .005 ms per call.  Not reason enough, imho, to avoid using the @ operator.

function x() { }

`There is no reason to NOT use something just because "it can be misused".  You could as well say "unlink is evil, you can delete files with it so don't ever use unlink".
It's a valid point that the @ operator hides all errors - so my rule of thumb is: use it only if you're aware of all possible errors your expression can throw AND you consider all of them irrelevant.
A simple example is
<?php
    $x = @$a["name"];
?>
There are only 2 possible problems here: a missing variable or a missing index.  If you're sure you're fine with both cases, you're good to go.  And again: suppressing errors is not a crime.  Not knowing when it's safe to suppress them is definitely worse.`

`Error suppression should be avoided if possible as it doesn't just suppress the error that you are trying to stop, but will also suppress errors that you didn't predict would ever occur. This will make debugging a nightmare.
It is far better to test for the condition that you know will cause an error before preceding to run the code. This way only the error that you know about will be suppressed and not all future errors associated with that piece of code.
There may be a good reason for using outright error suppression in favor of the method I have suggested, however in the many years I've spent programming web apps I've yet to come across a situation where it was a good solution. The examples given on this manual page are certainly not situations where the error control operator should be used.`

`It's still possible to detect when the @ operator is being used in the error handler in PHP8. Calling error_reporting() will no longer return 0 as documented, but using the @ operator does still change the return value when you call error_reporting().
My PHP error settings are set to use E_ALL, and when I call error_reporting() from the error handler of a non-suppressed error, it returns E_ALL as expected.
But when an error occurs on an expression where I tried to suppress the error with the @ operator, it returns: E_ERROR | E_PARSE | E_CORE_ERROR | E_COMPILE_ERROR | E_USER_ERROR | E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR (or the number 4437).
I didn't want to use 4437 in my code in case it changes with different settings or future versions of PHP, so I now use:
<?php
function my_error_handler($err_no, $err_msg, $filename, $linenum) {
      if (error_reporting() != E_ALL) {
         return false; // Silenced
      }
     // ...
}
?>
If the code needs to work with all versions of PHP, you could check that error_reporting() doesn't equal E_ALL or 0.
And, of course, if your error_reporting settings in PHP is something other than E_ALL, you'll have to change that to whatever setting you do use.`

`After some time investigating as to why I was still getting errors that were supposed to be suppressed with @ I found the following.
1. If you have set your own default error handler then the error still gets sent to the error handler regardless of the @ sign.
2. As mentioned below the @ suppression only changes the error level for that call. This is not to say that in your error handler you can check the given $errno for a value of 0 as the $errno will still refer to the TYPE(not the error level) of error e.g. E_WARNING or E_ERROR etc
3. The @ only changes the rumtime error reporting level just for that one call to 0. This means inside your custom error handler you can check the current runtime error_reporting level using error_reporting() (note that one must NOT pass any parameter to this function if you want to get the current value) and if its zero then you know that it has been suppressed.
<?php
// Custom error handler
function myErrorHandler($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline)
{
    if ( 0 == error_reporting () ) {
        // Error reporting is currently turned off or suppressed with @
        return;
    }
    // Do your normal custom error reporting here
}
?>

`If you use the ErrorException exception to have a unified error management, I'll advise you to test against error_reporting in the error handler, not in the exception handler as you might encounter some headaches like blank pages as error_reporting might not be transmitted to exception handler.
So instead of :
<?php
function exception_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline )
{
    throw new ErrorException($errstr, 0, $errno, $errfile, $errline);
}
set_error_handler("exception_error_handler");
function catchException($e)
{
    if (error_reporting() === 0)
    {
        return;
    }
    // Do some stuff
}
set_exception_handler('catchException');
?>
It would be better to do :
<?php
function exception_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline )
{
    if (error_reporting() === 0)
    {
        return;
    }
    throw new ErrorException($errstr, 0, $errno, $errfile, $errline);
}

{

`While you should definitely not be too liberal with the @ operator, I also disagree with people who claim it's the ultimate sin.
For example, a very reasonable use is to suppress the notice-level error generated by parse_ini_file() if you know the .ini file may be missing.
In my case getting the FALSE return value was enough to handle that situation, but I didn't want notice errors being output by my API.
TL;DR: Use it, but only if you know what you're suppressing and why.`

messages in dependency to the error_reporting() level and suppress output using the @-sign.`

`There is an error about error_reporting()'s return value inside an error handler in the documentation.
"Prior to PHP 8.0.0, the error_reporting() called inside the custom error handler always returned 0 if the error was suppressed by the @ operator. As of PHP 8.0.0, it returns the value of this (bitwise) expression: E_ERROR | E_CORE_ERROR | E_COMPILE_ERROR | E_USER_ERROR | E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR | E_PARSE."
In fact, in PHP 8.0.0+, error_reporting() in an error handler returns $error_reporting & (E_ERROR | E_CORE_ERROR | E_COMPILE_ERROR | E_USER_ERROR | E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR | E_PARSE), where $error_reporting is the value of the global error_reporting ini directive set, no matter through ini or error_reporting().`
