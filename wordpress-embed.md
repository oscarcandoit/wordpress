[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

With the WordPress Embed block, you can embed WordPress posts into your posts and pages. You don’t need a WordPress account to be able to use it. You can only embed public posts, though.

**An Example:**

**Steps to embed a WordPress Post**

1. **You need to find the URL of the Post.**

Find the URL of the WordPress post you want to embed in your page. Copy the link of that post from the search bar.

![Getting the URL for the WordPress embed](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/05/second-wordpress-embed.png)

2. **Go to your post or page**
3. **Add the WordPress block**

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)

4. **Paste the link into the text box and click the “Embed” button**

If it’s a link that can be successfully embedded you will see a preview in your editor.

If you’re using a link that cannot be embedded, the block shows a message, “ _Sorry, this content could not be embedded._”

You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or convert it to a link.

**6\. Click on “Preview” to see how it will look on the front-end.**

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-embed/\#block-toolbar)

Besides the Mover and Drag & Drop Handle, the Block Toolbar for the WordPress embed shows four buttons:

You can transform a WordPress embed to a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the WordPress embed.

**More Options**

### [Media Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-embed/\#media-settings)

![Media Settings you can control the behavior of your post embed](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-9.29.46-AM.png)![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-9.29.55-AM.png)

Via the _Media Settings_ you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
