[Go to the List of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

Use the Post Date block to display the date of the post. This block is primarily nested inside a [query loop](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/query-loop-block/) block and helps to customize the appearance of the query loop.

To add a Post Date block, click the **Block Inserter** icon when editing the page template. Search for the Post Date **block**. Click on it to add the block to your page template.

### [Move arrows:](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-date-block/\#move-arrows)

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-date-block/\#block-settings)

In addition to the block toolbar, every block has specific options in the editor sidebar.

### [Format](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-date-block/\#format)

On this tab, you can select the format to display the date from the dropdown as shown below:

![Default format option in Post Date block settings shows the list of date formats to choose from. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/post-date-block-format-482x1024.png)Post Date Format Settings

### [Link](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-date-block/\#link)

Turn on the ‘Link to post’ button in the Block Settings to link the post date to the URL of the post. This enables the website visitor to go to the post by clicking on the Post Date.

![Link settings shows a toggle button to turn the Post Date into a link.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-16-at-7.39.03-PM-1024x369.png)Link settings toggle button in the Post Date block sidebar

### [Last modified date](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-date-block/\#last-modified-date)

Enable the toggle option in the block settings sidebar, to display the last modified date.

![The last modified date shows a toggle button to turn the post date into last modified date. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/last-modified-date.png)Enabled last modified date from Post Date block sidebar

This block only displays the modified date if the “Display last modified date” setting is enabled and the post has been modified. If the setting is enabled, but the post has not been modified, then nothing is shown on the front.

**Note:**

The Post Date block changes into the Post modified Date block when you turn on the switch. You can also type /modified-date and hit enter to add the Post Modified Date block.

The “Advanced” tab lets you add CSS class(es) to your block. This will allow you to write custom CSS and styles to the block.

![Advanced setting in Post Date block shows a text field to add CSS class.](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HCaeEAd-xkijY3husAGN8FkRfOokz6h-mLa1vQoT11JIf366WEE4Y3jtoy6CTOJGTpBZELgZPdIewg2ug8pURV5XtFciGwLHJiNwleOvlGte5WnWTug0SYe4p-qBR54_8oR1NwHM)Advanced setting in Post Date block

### [Color](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-date-block/\#color)

You can customize the text color, background color, and link color for the Post Date block. _The color options available will vary based on the theme._

### [Dimension](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-date-block/\#dimension)

Padding and Margin can be quite useful for blocks like Post Date that are used in layouts for post templates. This screengrab demonstrates the usefulness of being able to adjust a single margin side when the block is used within a Row block:
