You can also discover and install third-party blocks from within the WordPress block editor using the [WordPress block directory](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-directory/).

To search the WordPress block directory, use the Block Inserter **+** icon on the top toolbar in the WordPress block editor and search for available blocks.

WordPress first runs a search on the available blocks that come with WordPress. If it’s unable to find any block that meets the criteria, it starts searching the block directory and gives you a list. Click on any from the list to install the third-party block.

The block directory search functionality is only available to WordPress users who have permission to install plugins. If you add a third-party block from the block directory, the corresponding WordPress plugin will be installed on your site.

## [How to search for blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/\#searching-for-blocks)

When you click the Block Inserter **+** icon to insert a new block, you can use the **search box** at the top to search for blocks.

Type in a block name or a keyword for example, `"image"` or `"heading"`. Then a list of blocks that fit the search term will show up in the modal window. You can also see a preview of the block below the list of blocks.

Select the desired block with the mouse click, tap, or arrow keys.
