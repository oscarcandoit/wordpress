[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The **Comments Title** block displays a title with the number of comments. The block is nested inside the Comments block and allows you to customize the comment title.

You can only insert the **Comments Title** block inside a Comments block.

By default, the **Comments Title** block is included when you insert the Comments block into the editor. However, you can still insert it manually when needed.

To add a **Comments Title** block, click the (+) icon inside the Comments block to open the block inserter window pop-up and look for the **Comments Title** block.

Alternatively, you can manually insert the **Comments Title** block using the keyboard shortcut `/comments-title.`

Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/).
