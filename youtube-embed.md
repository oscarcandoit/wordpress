[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

![YouTube icon](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-21-at-8.52.08-AM.png)

Using the YouTube Embed block you can include a YouTube video into your post/page with play buttons, so your visitor can stay on your site to watch it.

You don’t need a YouTube account to embed a video.

Not all videos can be shared this way, though. The publisher needs to “Allow Embedding” in the settings of the video and some publishers restrict the countries, where videos can be shared.

![This setting can be found YouTube Studio: Edit Video > More Options > Check "Allow embedding](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-21-at-8.54.45-AM.png)This setting can be found YouTube Studio:

Edit Video > More Options > Check “Allow embedding

Non-personal identifying viewing data will be shared with YouTube and the publisher of the video. _Please consult the [privacy policies and information](https://support.google.com/policies/answer/9664901) on YouTube if your site is visited by children._

**Six Steps to embed a YouTube Video in your post or page**

1. Find your video on YouTube.com, and copy the URL of the video from the browser bar

## [Embed other YouTube links](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/youtube-embed/\#embed-other-youtube-links)

### [Playlist](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/youtube-embed/\#playlist)

A playlist URL can be embedded and the first video of the list shows in the embed box, with additional navigation for the playlist in the top right corner.

![Playlist example of YouTube Gutenberg Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/youtube-block-playlist-example-5-9-1-1024x812.png)

### [Live Streams](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/youtube-embed/\#live-streams)

YouTube Live stream URLs are supported in the form of `youtube.com/live/videocode`

### [Unsupported URLs](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/youtube-embed/\#unsupported-urls)

Not all YouTube links can be used for an embed. When an URL is used that is not suited for embedding, the Block editor offers you two options: to try a different URL or convert the current URL into a Text link.

![Sorry - Content cannot be embedded example from Youtube.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/youtube-block-video-not-found-1024x683.png)

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/youtube-embed/\#block-toolbar)

Next to the YouTube icon is the “Drag & Drop Handle”. This can be used to drag your block to another section of your page.

Next to this is the “Mover”. Up and Down options are presented.

**Change Alignment**

After the first separator line you have the “Change alignment” tool.

![Changing alignment for the YouTube block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/youtube-block-toolbar-alignment.png)Change alignment option – YouTube Block

The alignment has variable options depending on your theme.

- **None – Default alignment option.**
- **Wide width – Increase the width of the post beyond the content size.**
- **Full width – Extend the block to cover the full width of the screen.**
- **Align left – Make the block left-aligned.**
- **Align center – Make the block alignment centered.**
- **Align right – Make the block right aligned.**

“Wide width” and “Full width” alignment need to be enabled by the Theme of your site.

**Edit URL**

Clicking on the Edit button will bring up the view for adjusting your URL for the Video Embed.

![YouTube URL paste example into block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/youtube-block-add-url-5-9-1024x411.png)

Via the edit URL, you can change the YouTube Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the “Embed” button on the right.

**More Options**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/youtube-embed/\#block-settings)

Besides the “Advanced” section, the YouTube embed has only one setting in the “Block Settings” sidebar: Media Settings.

### [Media Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/youtube-embed/\#media-settings)

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-9.29.46-AM.png)![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-9.29.55-AM.png)

Via the _Media Settings_ you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.

For a YouTube embed there are default CSS classes to allow for responsive handling of the embed when viewed on smaller devices like mobile phones.
