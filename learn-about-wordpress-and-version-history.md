# Learn about WordPress origins and version history

[↑ Back to top](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/learn-about-wordpress-and-version-history/#wp--skip-link--target)

WordPress was born out of a desire for an elegant, well-architectured personal publishing system built on PHP and MySQL and licensed under the GPL. It is the official successor of b2/cafelog. WordPress is modern software, but its roots and development go back to 2001. It is a mature and stable product. We hope that by focusing on user experience and web standards we can create a tool different from anything else out there.

There are also various post launch versions with improvements for security, bug fixes and stability. Please review the full [WordPress Release Archive](https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/) for details or check out the version announcements!
