[↑ Back to top](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/#wp--skip-link--target)

The Template Editor allows you to edit and create templates, using [blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/). These templates control the layout of the posts, pages, or page types on your site.

The Template Editor is **only** available if your site is using a [block theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/) or a classic theme that has enabled the Template Editor on the backend.

## [About Templates](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/\#about-templates)

WordPress uses templates to create the layout and structure for posts, pages, or specific page types on your site page. There are a few base templates that are generated when you select a theme. For example:

- The **Home** template is used to display the site’s home page if your site is set up to display the [latest posts](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-reading-screen/#reading-settings) on the home page.
- The **Index** template is used to display the index page of all the blog posts.
- The **Page** template is used to display the site’s pages if no specific templates are assigned to the page.
- Many block themes offer other built-in templates like the **Single Post** template to customize the layout of single blog posts, the **404** template to customize the layout of the 404 error page, the **Search** template to customize the layout of the search results page, and the **Archive** template for categories/archives page, etc.

In addition, your [block theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/) may come bundled with custom templates.

In the Template Editor, you can find all the templates on your site, including any custom templates you created and the ones that came bundled with your theme. You can edit these templates and create custom layouts using [blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/).

When you make changes to a template, the editor updates the blocks on all pages/posts that use the template. These changes take precedence over your theme’s bundled template files.

## [What you need, to use the Template Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/\#how-to-access-this-feature)

To work with the Template Editor, you need to use a [block theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/) on your site. A block theme is a theme that uses [blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/) for all parts of a site, including navigation menus, header, content, and site footer.

All [blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/) that are available in the [WordPress Block editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/) can be used in the Template Editor. To find block themes, from the WordPress dashboard, go to **Appearance** \> **Themes** and click **Add New**. In the **Add Themes** page, select **Block Themes** to find the growing list of [Block themes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/) in the [WordPress theme directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/).

![How to find a block theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-9.36.15-AM-2-1024x493.png)How to find a block theme

Once you install and activate a Block theme on your site, go to **Appearance** \> **Editor** to open the Site Editor.

## [Two ways to access the Template Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/\#how-to-find-this-feature)

There are two different ways you can access the Template Editor depending on what type of theme you are using:

- If you are using a [block theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/), you can access the Template Editor when editing posts or pages via the [WordPress Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/) and also via the [Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/).
- If you are using a classic theme that has enabled the Template Editor on the backend, you can access the Template Editor only when editing posts or pages via the [WordPress Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/).

## [How to use the Template Editor via the WordPress Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/\#how-to-edit-templates-via-the-post-editor)

To use the Template Editor via the WordPress Block Editor, make sure your site is using a [block theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/) or a classic theme that has enabled the Template Editor on the backend.

This is helpful, for example, if you want to show a grid of posts for a specific “photography” category but not change the default list style for others.

To create a custom category template, select **Category** from the drop-down menu, after you choose to add a new template. A new dialog will appear with two choices:

### [To add an archive and single template for custom post types](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/\#to-add-an-archive-and-single-template-for-custom-post-types)

### [To create a new custom template](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/\#to-create-a-new-custom-template)

A custom template can be assigned to any post, page, or custom post type.

When you add a new template from the list of choices provided in the Template Editor, they are automatically assigned to their respective page, post, or post type. For eg: The Author template gets automatically assigned to posts based on authors. When you create a new custom template, it is not assigned to anything specific until you assign a template to the post or page.

To create a custom template, select **Custom Template** from the drop-down menu, after you choose to add a new template. In the dialog that appears, give a name for the new custom template and click **Create**. Make sure the name describes the template eg: Post with sidebar.

Changing a page’s template affects that page only (not your entire site.)

## [How to rename custom templates](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/\#how-to-rename-custom-templates)

You can only rename a custom template that you created. This means the default templates in WordPress and custom templates that came bundled with your theme cannot be renamed.

- This will open a dialog box where you can type in a new name for the custom template you selected. Make sure the name describes the template eg: Post with sidebar.
- Click **Save** to save the custom template with the new name.

Renaming a custom template from the template list

## [Clear customizations to templates in your block theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/\#clear)

When changes are made to templates that came bundled with your block theme, you will see the option to clear customizations.

You can see whether a template has been customized in 2 locations.

1. In the detail view you will see an additional ‘customized’ label on templates with customizations.
2. When viewing the details of the template you will see a note indicating when the template was last updated, at the bottom of the details column.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-08-at-5.26.28-pm-1024x75.png)Customized label shows in the ‘All Templates’ view![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-08-at-5.26.14-pm-1024x581.png)‘Last Modified’ indicates this template has customizations

This feature is **only** available for the templates that you have already customized. If you don’t find this option, it means your template is already in its default state.
