You can use the color settings in your [block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/) to set the text color, background color, link color, gradient options, and duotone filters for your content. They are designed to make it as simple as possible to update your block’s colors.

The color settings available will vary based on the theme and the block in use.

## [How to access color settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/\#how-to-access-color-settings)

Colors can be set on a site basis or on a block basis. Setting color on a site basis will affect the color of the entire site.

### [How to access color settings for your site](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/\#how-to-access-color-settings-for-your-site)

1. From your Administration Screens, Select Appearance > Editor
2. Select Styles
3. Select Colors

### [How to access color settings for a single block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/\#how-to-access-color-settings-for-a-single-block)

1. Select the block you want to modify the color
2. Open the Block Settings sidebar of a block by clicking the Settings icon that is to the right of the Publish or Save buttons.

### [Viewing all settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/\#viewing-all-settings)

![All color settings and Reset all](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/color-settings-all-settings-6.8-300x151.jpg)All color settings and Reset all

In the Color section, click on the three-dot menu (also known as an ellipsis) to explore all the color settings that are not visible by default. Note that not every block supports all the color settings.

### [Resetting all settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/\#resetting-all-settings)

If you make customizations to these settings and want to revert back to the original settings quickly, you can do so by selecting the three-dot menu icon and clicking **Reset all**. This resets the settings and removes all of your changes.

## [Type of settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/\#type-of-settings)

Each supported block comes with different color settings.

### [Text and background colors](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/\#text-and-background-colors)

This option allows you to change the color of the text, and background on the block you are working on. A combination of these color settings can be used to call attention to your most important content.

You can pick a color from the color palette of your theme. You can also add a custom color from the color picker or enter the HEX, RGB, or HSL color values based on your brand. Click the two rectangle boxes next to the color slider to copy the HEX, RGB, or HSL color values.

Accessibility tests are built into the editor to warn you when the text may become hard to read against the background color choices as shown.

### [Link colors](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/\#link-colors)

On some blocks, you will find the option to change the link color.

### [Gradient background colors](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/\#gradient-background-colors)

Some blocks such as the [Heading block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/heading-block/) allow you to set either a solid color or a gradient as the background. A gradient is a mix of two or more colors, displayed using a certain pattern (from lighter to darker, or one color blending into the other).

A slider will appear that shows the two color points that make up the gradient.

![Color points in the gradient](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/image-2.png)

You can click on any of the two color points to display the color picker for changing the color value. You can either choose a color from the color picker or enter the HEX, RGB, or HSL color values.

You can add additional color points if you like by clicking the **+** icon that appears when you hover over the gradient slider.

![Gradient type](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/color-settings-gradient-type-1024x849.jpg)Screenshot

You can choose between the **Linear** or **Radial** gradient type. The angle control shifts the position of the gradient.

The **Linear** type creates a gradient between the two colors along a straight line, whereas the **Radial** type starts from the center and moves to the borders.

![Liner and Radial gradient options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/gradient-example.png)

### [Duotone filter](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/\#duotone-filter)

You can create a two-tone color effect (called the duotone effect) on images without actually changing the original image

The duotone filter option allows you to add this filter color to your block content from the block toolbar. The filter can be black, white, or _any_ other color combination of your choosing. The duotone effect works best on high-contrast images.

To get started, select the Duotone filter icon in the block toolbar. You can pick the two colors for the effect from the list of duotone presets provided in the drop-down.

You can also pick your own colors for the shadows and highlights by clicking on the **Shadows** / **Highlights** option which opens up the color picker and then selecting your custom color from the color palette.

If you want to remove the duotone filter you can click the **Clear** button found at the bottom-right of the color palette.

## [Reset settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/\#reset-settings)

When hovering over the Color option, if a color has been selected, a reset button (displayed as a dash icon) will appear. Clicking this button will remove the applied color and reset the field to its default state, indicating “No color selected.”
