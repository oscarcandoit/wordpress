[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The **Search Results Title** blockdisplays a title above the search results. You can add this block to the search template in a theme that supports full site editing.

If you add this block in other templates, a page, or a post, the block won’t appear on the website’s front end.

To add one, open the search template in the [Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/) by clicking on the site icon (or the W icon, if no site icon is set for the site) and select **Templates**. Then choose the **Search** template from the list (If you don’t find the **Search** template, click **Add New** button and add the **Search** template to your theme). In the **Search** template, click the **Block Inserter** (+) icon and add the **Search Results Title** block to the template.

Refer to this support article for [detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/).

Now, if you perform a search on your website, you’ll see the search results title on the search page.

**Block moving tools**

The **Drag** button lets you drag and drop the Search Results Title block and reposition it anywhere on the editor, while the **Move up** and **Move down** buttons let you move the Search Results Title block up or down on the editor.

- _Select parent block_ will move you to the parent block that contains the Search Results Title block. This option is only available if the Search Results Title block is inside a container block.

- _Insert after_ adds a new block after the selected block(s).

- _Lock_ lets you prevent users from moving or deleting the selected block. A pop-up window will appear to set the block locking attribute to the selected block. You can opt to disable movement, prevent removal, or both for the selected block.
- _Create Template part_ allows you to create a new template from the selected block. A pop-up window will appear to name the template part and select the template area.
- _Create pattern/reusable block_ makes the selected blocks a pattern. A pop-up window will appear to set the name for the pattern and enable synced option.
- _Group_ turns the selected block(s) into a group of blocks so you can configure them as a unit.
- _Remove Search Results Title_ deletes the selected block from the content.
