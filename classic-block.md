[Go back to the list of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The _classic block_ looks just like the classic editor, but it’s in block form. Custom TinyMCE buttons are found in this block.

In order to add a classic block, click on the **Block Inserter** icon.

You can also type /classic and hit enter in a new paragraph block to add one quickly.

Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/).

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/classic-block/\#block-toolbar)

Each block has its own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

![The classic block has a toolbar option  for converting classic content to blocks.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/classic-block-WP-62-1024x309.png)

### [Convert to blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/classic-block/\#convert-to-blocks)

Selecting this option will convert the content to blocks.

### [More Options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/classic-block/\#more-options)

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

### [Classic editor toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/classic-block/\#classic-editor-toolbar)

Once you [add the block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/#adding-a-block), you can edit the text you add as you would in the classic visual editor, using the tools provided.

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/classic-block/\#block-settings)

While most blocks have specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar, the classic block does not have any additional options.
