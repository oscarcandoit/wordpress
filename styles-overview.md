Styles is a new feature that allows you to set the overall aesthetics and layout of your site at a global level, instead of editing individual blocks or pages. It is included in [block themes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/) and requires WordPress 5.9 or higher.

You can set the colors, typography, layout, spacing, and more, for the entire site and give your website a cohesive look that shows off your brand.

You can also edit the default appearance of blocks to streamline the look and feel of your website — add your unique colors to create a branded Button block, or adjust the Heading block to your preferred font size.

## [How styles work](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#how-styles-works)

The styles you set from within the **Styles** interface impact your entire site. For eg: if you change the background color here, it changes the background color of all your posts, pages, and templates.

In the **Styles** panel, you will find the styles and default settings provided by your theme and the ones that come with WordPress.

You can override these settings with your own choices from the **Styles** panel. For eg: you can add your own custom colors to the color palette, change the layout dimensions, and more.

![Image showing the Styles sidebar open with all options listed.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-13-at-8.57.28-AM-131x300.png)Styles sidebar

You can also customize the appearance of specific blocks for the entire site. For eg: you can choose a background color and set the font size and line height for all the Quote blocks on your site.

## [How to use the styles panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#how-to-find-styles)

To access this feature, you will need to install and activate a [block theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/) and be using WordPress 5.9 or higher.

Go to **Appearance** \> **Editor**. Select the half-shaded circle icon at the top right-hand corner of the screen, above the block settings sidebar, to access the **Styles** panel. The **Styles** icon is available in the [Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/), and when editing the [template](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/) or [template parts](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-part-block/).

In the **Styles** panel, you will see sections for **Typography**, **Colors,** and **Layout**. Any changes made from here will affect the entire site.

You will also find a section for **Blocks**. Clicking on the **Blocks** section will show you a list of all the blocks. You can select any block type and customize the appearance of that particular block, across the whole site.

### [The styles welcome guide](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#the-styles-welcome-guide)

When you open the **Styles** panel for the first time, you will be taken to a **Welcome Guide** dialog. You can click through the guide using the **Next** and **Previous** links at the bottom or close the dialog by clicking the **X** icon at the top right corner of the dialog.

![Welcome guide in the Styles interface](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-13-at-10.12.27-AM-1024x468.png)Welcome guide

If you want to access the **Welcome Guide** in the future, you can find it by clicking on the three vertical dots icon in the upper right-hand corner and selecting **Welcome Guide**.

![A red arrow pointing to the three dot menu where, when clicked, the Welcome Guide can be opened. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-27-at-3.49.28-PM.png)

### [Style variations](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#style-variations)

![How to use the style variations](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-13-at-12.04.54-PM.png)

Style variations are a new feature of [block themes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/) that were introduced in WordPress 6.0.

With these style variations, you are presented with alternate versions of your [block theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/) with different combinations of colors, fonts, typography, spacing, block settings, and more. You can easily swap the style variations and change the look and feel of your site without changing your theme.

1. In the **Styles** panel, you can find a screenshot of the Style variation that your site is currently using.
2. Select **Browse styles** at the bottom of the screenshot to explore the different style variations available with your [block theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/). From the available choices, you can pick a different style combination and instantly see how your site looks with this style variation, in the Editor.
3. Click the left arrow icon to go back to the **Styles** panel.

### [Color and typography style variations](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#color-and-typography-style-variations)

Color and typography variations are subsets of the existing global style variations system that were introduced in WordPress 6.6. Color and typography variations are limited in scope to—as their names imply—colors and typography.

When they are available, these variations appear as new options in the Appearance > Editor > Styles sidebar panel and elsewhere:

### [Typography](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#typography)

This section allows you to manage the various typography settings for the different elements – text, links, headings, and buttons – for the entire site.

- Click **Typography** to open the Typography panel. Select the element you want to customize and it will open up the **Typography** panel for that element.

Preset typography options are now available in the Styles interface. These presets, defined by the theme, provide a curated set of font sizes, line heights, and other typographic values that help maintain consistency across your site.

![Typography customization settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/typography-1-6.8-392x1024.png)

- You can change the typography settings including font type, font size, appearance, line height and text decoration. As you pick your choices you can see a preview of how it looks.

![Interactive previews of typography settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/typography-2-6.8.png)

- As you attempt to change the font type, each option in the dropdown shows a preview of the font.

![List of fonts with live previews](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/typography-3-6.8.png)

- You can choose a font size from the preset options: S, M, L, XL, and XXL, or define a custom size using units like px, em, or rem.

- You can customize typography settings for heading elements from H1 to H6, including:

1. **Font Family**: Choose from a range of available fonts, each with a live preview.
2. **Font Size**: Select from preset sizes (S, M, L, XL, XXL) or define custom values and units.
3. **Font Style**: Choose from Default (inherited from general typography settings), Regular, Bold, Italic, or Bold Italic.
4. **Line Height & Letter Spacing**: Adjust both with customizable units.
5. **Text Decoration**: Apply styles such as None, Underline, or Strikethrough.
6. **Text Orientation & Letter Case**: Modify text direction and transform casing as needed.
8. You can change the typography settings for heading elements from `H1` through `H6`.

#### [Font size presets](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#font-size-presets)

Font size presets provide a set of predefined size options that can be applied consistently across blocks and elements. These presets are defined by the theme and appear in the typography controls as labeled choices such as Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large and Extra Extra Large, making it easier for users to select appropriate font sizes without manually entering values.

![Define and manage the predefined font size options available throughout the site.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/style-font-size-preset-1-6.8.png)

You can modify a font size preset by clicking on the one you want to change. In this example, we’ll adjust the preset named Small. You’ll see a live preview along with options to set a custom size using various units such as px, em, rem, vw, and vh. You can use the slider to adjust the value or enter a specific size manually.

![Managing or customising the font size preset](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/style-font-size-preset-2-6.8.png)

Note: The standard size input will be disabled if you enable **Custom fluid values**.

When using custom fluid values, you can define both a minimum and maximum size, with the same range of supported units as the standard size option.

![Customising fluid values of font preset](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/style-font-size-preset-3-6.8.png)

### [Colors](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#colors)

This section allows you to manage the color palettes and the default color of different global elements on the site. This includes your site’s background color, and the colors for texts, links, headings, and buttons.

- Click **Colors** to open the **Color** panel. At the top, you will find the color palette used by the style variation of your active block theme. You will also find the list of elements whose default global color can be customized through the Color settings panel.

Starting with WordPress 6.7, the **Color** interface introduces a new preset color palette that provides a curated set of default colors designed to complement your theme’s design. These presets serve as a consistent foundation for applying color across blocks and global elements, helping to maintain visual harmony and accessibility throughout your site.

![Preset color palette option](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/styles-color-palette-preset-6.9.png)

### [Layout](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#layout)

![Setting the content widths in Layout Panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-15-at-11.16.11-AM-2.png)

This section allows you to set the width of the main content area of your website globally.

You can set the **content** width and **wide** width in PX, %, EM, REM, VW and VH units. The content width set here will be the default width of the blocks when they set **Align** to **None** in the Block Toolbar. The wide width set here will be the width of the blocks when they set **Align** to **Wide width** in the Block Toolbar.

To reset the values for **Content** and **Wide**, click the three vertical dots icon and select **Content size** or **Wide size** and the changes you made are reverted.

![Reverting the Content and Wide size](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-15-at-3.11.04-PM-2.png)

You can also set the **Padding** or the blank space around your website from the **Layout** panel.

- You can set the padding on the four sides: top, right, bottom, and left.
- By default, **Padding** is locked which means that when you adjust the padding value it applies to all four sides. If you click the link icon, it unlinks the sides and you can set the **Padding** on each side individually.

![Padding linked in the Layout Panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-15-at-12.18.12-PM-1-1.png)Padding linked![Padding unlinked in the Layout Panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-15-at-12.18.25-PM-518x1024.png)Padding unlinked

- **Padding** can be set in PX, %, EM, REM, VW, and VH units.
- You can add values to the text box or use the slider to adjust the values for **Padding**.

Built into the Styles experience are preset spacing values for padding. Your theme author can set baseline values for spacing and when you use the Styles’ padding preset slider, you can create consistent spacing across the elements within the site.

- Clicking the black slider icon in the right corner (next to the link icon) will show the padding space preset slider.

![Use the padding preset](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-15-at-2.53.07-PM-2.png)

- To reset the values for **Padding**, click the three vertical dots icon and select **Padding** and the changes you made are reverted.

Video showing how to set Padding in Styles

In the Layout panel, you can also set the **Block spacing** which is the vertical spacing between the blocks.

- **Block spacing** can be set in PX, %, EM, REM, VW, and VH units.
- You can add values to the text box or use the slider to adjust the values for **Block spacing**.

Similar to padding, WordPress comes with preset spacing guidelines that your theme author can set baseline values for and when you use the Styles’ block spacing preset slider, you can create consistent block spacing between the blocks.

- Clicking the black slider icon in the right corner (next to the link icon) will show the block spacing preset slider.
- To reset the values for **Block spacing**, click the three vertical dots icon and select **Block spacing,** and the changes you made are reverted.

### [Background](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#background)

The Background section in Styles allows you to upload and apply a background image to your site.

Add background image to the site

### [Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#blocks)

In the **Blocks** panel, you will see a list of all the blocks that can be customized for the whole site. You can also search for a block by its name in the search box. Click on a block from the list to see the available options for that block.

The changes you make to the blocks’ appearances in the Styles panel affect every block of that type on your site unless they are customized individually on your post or page. For example, if you set a custom color for a Button block on your Home page, the color set in the Styles panel for the Button block will be overwritten by the color you choose on the Home page.

As you make changes, as of WordPress 6.2, you will see a live preview of the impact of those changes you’re making as shown below:

Each block has its own set of options to customize. For example, you can customize the border, radius, duotone, etc. for the [Image block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/image-block/) or change the paddings, margins, colors, and fonts for the [Heading block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/heading-block/).

#### [Margin settings for blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#margin-settings-for-blocks)

**Padding** is the space between a block’s content and its border whereas **Margin** is the space outside the border of a block.

The following blocks have a **Margin** control for **Top**, **Right**, **Bottom,** and **Left**, in the **Blocks** section under **Layouts**.

By default, **Margin** is locked which means that when you adjust the margin value it applies to all sides. If you click the link icon, it unlinks the sides and you can set the **Margin** on each side individually.

![Margin linked in the Blocks Layout Panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-16-at-12.44.51-PM-1.png)![Margin unlinked in the Blocks Layout Panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-16-at-12.45.03-PM-521x1024.png)

Your theme author can set baseline values for spacing and when you use the Styles’ margin preset slider, you can create consistent spacing across the elements within the site.

Clicking the slider icon in the right corner (next to the link icon) will switch the **Margin** controls from the preset slider to the text box view. You can add values to the text box or use the slider to adjust the values for **Margin**. **Margin** can be set in PX, %, EM, REM, VW, and VH units.

![Use custom size for margin](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-16-at-12.56.47-PM-2.png)

To reset the values for **Margin**, click the three vertical dots icon and select **Margin,** and the changes you made are reverted.

Using the **Border** controls, you can set the border around a block. You can choose the border color from the color picker. You can set the border width in PX, %, EM, REM, VW or VH, by entering the width in the text box or the slider to adjust the values.

![Border color and width using the slider and text box.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-16-at-5.24.47-PM-1024x631.png)

![Border width unlinked.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-16-at-5.23.46-PM-1.png)

Using the **Radius** controls, you can round the corners of a block’s outer border. You can also set the border Radius in PX, %, EM, REM, VW, or VH, by entering the value in the text box or by adjusting the slider.

By default, border radius is locked which means that when you adjust the value it applies to all four corners. If you click the link icon, it unlinks the corners and you can set the radius on each corner individually – Top left, Top right, Bottom left, and Bottom right.

#### [Horizontal block spacing settings for blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#horizontal-block-spacing-settings-for-blocks)

The following blocks have **Horizontal Block spacing** control in the **Blocks** section under **Layouts**.

- Columns
- Social Icons

By default, the **Block Spacing** control is locked which means that when you adjust the value it applies to both the horizontal and vertical. If you click the link icon, it unlinks and you can set the **Block Spacing** for vertical and horizontal separately.

#### [Editing block variations](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#editing-block-variations)

Some blocks come built in with variations, different options of the same block. When that’s the case, as of WordPress 6.2, you will see the option

#### [Adding box shadows to button block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#adding-box-shadows-to-button-block)

With WordPress 6.2, there are four shadow presets you can choose from by default. The following come by default for you to use:

- Natural
- Crisp
- Sharp
- Soft

## [Styling the site tagline](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#styling-the-site-tagline)

The Global Styles section lets the users set and unset the Site Tagline. Users can also update the font and color of the site tagline through this section. This is an optional setting which the users can utilize if they as per their needs.

![how to style the site tagline](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/03/220521940-b6df89c3-63ed-4ff1-b3c0-e66ac6009c1a-1024x704.png)

## [Preview your changes with style book](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#preview-with-style-book)

When making changes to the styles of your site, whether changing to a different style variation or tweaking an individual block, it’s imperative to see the cascading impact. With the addition of the style book in WordPress 6.2, a view that you can toggle on and off as you would like, you can see all of your blocks on your site as you make changes:

## [Applying Custom CSS](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#applying-custom-css)

The Site Editor seeks to enable customization at every level across your site. In some cases, as features are being built, there are gaps in what’s possible. As a result, it’s recommended to start first from the options available within Styles before adding custom CSS. For any current gaps, you can add Custom CSS. Note that any CSS changes you make _won’t_ be overwritten by a theme update, but they _will_ be cleared when you switch themes.

### [Site-wide Custom CSS](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#site-wide-custom-css)

A site-wide custom CSS editor is built into the Styles interface, as of WordPress 6.2. Click the three dot menu and select “Additional CSS.” Any CSS added here is applied across the entire site.

![Additional CSS option visible from the three dot menu in the Style interface with a red arrow pointing to it to highlight the location. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-27-at-4.15.11-PM.png)![Screenshot of Additional CSS panel with an example of CSS to change the colour of the Post Excerpt's Continue Reading Link](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/global-css-editor.png)

Once any global Custom CSS is saved, an Additional CSS field is displayed in the top-level Styles interface.

![Additional CSS option visible from the main Style interface with a red arrow pointing to it to highlight the location. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-27-at-4.17.32-PM-432x1024.png)

### [Per-block CSS](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#per-block-css)

As you navigate to each individual block under Styles > Blocks, you’ll find an “Additional block CSS” section. When you add CSS here, it applies only to that specific block type, throughout the entire site.

![Additional block CSS option visible from within the Styles interface for an individual block with a red arrow pointing to it to highlight the location. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-27-at-4.23.19-PM-460x1024.png)

Because CSS added here is for a specific block type, you should not add a selector or curly braces. Follow the `property: value` format.

For example, if you wanted to display the quotation portion of the Quote block in italics, you could add this in the Quote block’s CSS editor:

```
font-style: italic;
```

Here’s how that looks in the editor:

![Editor screenshot showing Quote block with italicized text and the CSS in the block's Additional CSS editor which reads: font-style: italic;](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/quote-block-css.png)

And this is how the CSS is output on the front end:

```
.wp-block-quote {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

Notice how WordPress automatically adds the `property: value` pair to the block’s selector.

By using CSS combinators like spaces and `<` or pseudo-classes and -elements, you can create more complex effects, including hover states. You can also use the ampersand ( `&`) as in SASS/LESS, to target a nested element.

For example, here’s some CSS you could add in the Button block’s CSS editor to create a hover state for the Button block:

```
:hover {
  background: #bb00bb;
}
```

Note that in this case, you _do_ need to include curly braces in the code. The resulting CSS on the front end is:

```
.wp-block-button .wp-block-button__link:hover {
  background: #bb00bb;
}
```

## [Reset your changes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/\#resources)

To revert back to the theme styles you had, before making changes, click on the three vertical dots icon in the upper right-hand corner of the **Styles** panel, and select **Reset to defaults**.
