The Query Title block displays a dynamic heading based on the type of content being viewed, such as a category name, search term etc.

It has two main variations:

## [Archive Title](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/query-title-block/\#archive-title)

- Displays the title of the current archive page, such as a category, tag, author, or date.
- To add a Archive Title block, click the Block Inserter (+) icon, search for “Archive Title”, and select it from the list to insert it into your template.

## [Search Result Title](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/query-title-block/\#search-result-title)

- Displays a heading based on the user’s search query.
- To add a Search Results Title block, click the Block Inserter (+) icon, search for “Search Results Title”, and select it from the list to insert it into your template.

Both of these are built on top of the same underlying block (core/query-title) and share the same functionality and controls — they differ only in what type of content they’re designed to display.

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/query-title-block/\#block-toolbar)

To view the block toolbar, click on the block, and the toolbar will be displayed.

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons and blocks specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

**The Query Title block shows seven buttons in the block toolbar ( From Left to Right ):**
