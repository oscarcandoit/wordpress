Unless overridden, these commands run on the `before_wp_load` hook, just before the WP load process begins.

WP-CLI packages are community-maintained projects built on WP-CLI. They can contain WP-CLI commands, but they can also just extend WP-CLI in some way.

Learn how to create your own command from the
[Commands Cookbook](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/guides/commands-cookbook/)
