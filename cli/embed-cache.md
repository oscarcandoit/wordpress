By default, the WP Object Cache exists in PHP memory for the length of the request (and is emptied at the end). Use a persistent object cache drop-in to persist the object cache between requests.

[Read the codex article](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Object_Cache) for more detail.
