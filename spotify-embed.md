[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

With the Spotify Embed block, you can embed tracks, podcasts, playlists & albums into your posts and pages. You need a Spotify account to be able to listen to entire tracks. For users who are not logged in on their Spotify account, the Spotify Play button embed plays a 30-second long audio preview, and then the users are prompted to either login or to sign up. You don’t need a Spotify account to embed a track, podcast, playlist or album.

If you use a URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message _“Sorry, this content could not be embedded.”_ You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or convert to link.

**Transform to**:

You can transform a Spotify embed to a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the Spotify embed.

### [Media Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/spotify-embed/\#media-settings)

Via the _Media Settings_ you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
