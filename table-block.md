[Go to the List of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/support/article/blocks/)

Use the _Table_ block to easily create a table in any post or page.

![Table block on the editor canvas](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/table-block.png)

To add the _Table_ block to a page, click the **Add block** button to open the block inserter pop-up window and choose the _Table_ block.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/main-placeholder-1024x417.png)![A demo on how to use the Table block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/adding-table-block.gif)

You can also use the keyboard shortcut `/table` to quickly insert a _Table_ block. Remember that tables are best used for tabulated data rather than page design. For example, if you want columns, you can use the [Columns Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/).

Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/).

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/table-block/\#block-toolbar)

To view the block toolbar, click on the block, and the toolbar will be displayed.

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons and blocks specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The _Table_ block shows 11 buttons in the block toolbar:
