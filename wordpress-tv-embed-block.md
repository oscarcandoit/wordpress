**Steps to Embed a video from WordPress.tv:**

1. Find the video permalink

In the web player select the video and click on the “Share” button.

![A sample video in the WordPress.tv page](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/07/WordPress.tv-Embed-Doc-SS-1.png)

2. In the share section, click on the permalink and it will be automatically copied, or alternatively, you can highlight the link and copy it.

![Finding the share link in the WordPress.tv post](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/07/WordPress.tv-Doc-SS-2.png)

If you add a link in some other way and the link can’t be embedded, you have the option of trying again or converting the URL to a link.

3. Add a WordPress.tv embed block to your page/post

![How to quickly add a WordPress.tv block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/07/WordPress.tv-Doc-SS-3.png)

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)

4. Paste the link into the text box and click on the “Embed” button

![Paste the URL into the WordPress.tv block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/07/WordPress.tv-Doc-SS-4-1024x427.png)

If it’s a link that can be successfully embedded you will see a preview in your editor.

![Preview on the WordPress.tv block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/07/WordPress.tv-Embed-Doc-SS-5-1024x724.png)

If you use an URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message _“Sorry, this content could not be embedded.”_

![Error displayed when the content could not be embedded in the WordPress.tv block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/07/WordPress.tv-Embed-Doc-SS-6-1024x573.png)

You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or convert it to a link.

5. Click on “Preview” to see how it will look on the front-end

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-tv-embed-block/\#block-toolbar)

Besides the _Mover_ and _Drag & Drop_ handle, the Block Toolbar for the WordPress.tv embed shows four buttons:

- Transform To
- Block moving tools
- Change Alignment
- Edit URL
- More Options

![Block toolbar in the WordPress.tv block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/07/WordPress.tv-Embed-Doc-SS-8.png)

You can transform WordPress.tv embed block to a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around WordPress.tv embed.

**Change Alignment**

![Change alignment in the WordPress.tv block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/07/WordPress.tv-Embed-Doc-SS-12-1024x687.png)

- **Align left** – Make the block left-aligned.
- **Align center** – Make the block alignment centered.
- **Align right**– Make the block right-aligned.
- **Wide width** – Increase the width of the block beyond the content size.
- **Full width** – Extend the block to cover the full width of the screen.

The “Wide width” and “Full width” alignment settings must be enabled by your WordPress theme.

**Edit URL**

Via the edit URL, you can change the WordPress.tv Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the “Embed” button.

![Edit URL in the WordPress.tv block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/07/WordPress.tv-Embed-Doc-SS-13-1024x421.png)

**More Options**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-tv-embed-block/\#block-settings)

**Media Settings**

Besides the Advanced section, the WordPress.tv embed has only one setting in the “Block Settings” sidebar: Media Settings.

**Media Settings**

![Media settings for the embed block with the toggle OFF for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-9.29.46-AM.png)

![Media settings for the embed block with the toggle ON for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/06/media-settings-2-1.png)

Via the _Media Settings_ you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position, the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

![Advanced settings in the WordPress.tv block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/Screenshot-9.png)

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
