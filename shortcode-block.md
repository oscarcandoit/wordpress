A shortcode is a WordPress-specific code that lets you do nifty things with very little effort. Shortcodes can embed files or create objects that would normally require lots of complicated, ugly code in just one line. **Shortcode = shortcut**.

The _shortcode block_ can be added to a page by clicking on the Add Block button. It can be found in _Widgets_ section. Alternatively, you can type /shortcode and press enter.

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)

In this video, you can see how you can use the short block and the different settings to modify how your content will appear.

How the shortcode block works

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/shortcode-block/\#block-toolbar)

Unlike other common blocks, the _shortcode block_ does not include any specific settings in the block toolbar or editor sidebar.

[![Shortcode Block Editor Sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/shortcode-with-no-extra-settings-1024x486.png)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/shortcode-with-no-extra-settings.png) Shortcode Block Editor Sidebar

**Writing Your Shortcode**

You may type your shortcode into the box provided or paste it from the available shortcodes.

**More Options**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/shortcode-block/\#block-settings)

Every block has specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar. _If you do not see the sidebar, simply click the ‘cog’ icon next to the Publish button._

As you can see, the _shortcode block_ doesn’t include specific settings in the block settings.

You can transform a _shortcode block_ into a group or into a columns, so you can further apply custom settings to the block.

**Color**

Text and background colors can be set on a per-block basis, allowing you to call attention to important content.

Via the “Custom Color” link you can further modify the color choice.

[See this guide for more information about changing colors.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/)

Accessibility parameters are built into the new editor to warn you when the text may become illegible for persons with reading impairments.

**Advanced**

In the advanced panel of the block options, you’ll see options for HTML Anchor and Additional CSS Class.

![Advanced settings for the shortcode](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-22-at-12.07.36-PM.png)

“HTML anchor” allows you to [make a unique web address](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-jumps/) for a particular Heading block. Then, you’ll be able to link directly to the Heading block of your page.

The “Additional CSS class(es)” lets you add CSS class(es) to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
