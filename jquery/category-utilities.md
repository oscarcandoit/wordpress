Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object.

Merge the contents of an object onto the jQuery prototype to provide new jQuery instance methods.

Execute some JavaScript code globally.

Determine whether the argument is an array.

Check to see if an object is empty (contains no enumerable properties).

Determines if its argument is callable as a function.

Determines whether its argument represents a JavaScript number.

Check to see if an object is a plain object (created using “{}” or “new Object”).

Show or manipulate the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements.
