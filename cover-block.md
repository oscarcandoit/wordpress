[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#block-settings)

WordPress blocks have specific configuration options in the block settings panel. To access the **Cover** block settings panel, click the Settings button at the top-right corner of the editor screen.

The **Cover** block settings panel is divided into two tabs – Settings and Styles. It contains the following sections:

### [Layout](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#layout)

![The layout settings for the cover block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/10/image-6.png)

In the Layout section, you will see the following customization options:

- The _Inner blocks use the content width toggle_ button, allowing nested blocks to use content width with options for full and wide widths.
- The _Content width_ tool lets you customize the width for all elements assigned to the center or wide columns.

### [Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#settings)

![Image settings for Cover block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/cover-block-1-6.8.png)

#### [Fixed background](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#fixed-background)

![Fixed background setting for the cover image ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/12/Screenshot54545dffd.png)Fixed background setting for the cover image

In the block settings on the sidebar, you have some other options, the first of which is a toggle for a fixed background. A fixed background means the cover image scrolls along with your page. Turning this option off embeds the image in place, so the image doesn’t scroll.

#### [Repeated background](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#repeated-background)

![Repeated background settings for the cover image](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/Screenshot-repeated123.png)

The **Repeated background** option lets you repeat the same image to form a pattern in the Cover block. For example, if you have a small image and you want it to repeat multiple times in the Cover block, you can enable this option.

You can use the **Repeated background** toggle in combination with **Fixed background**, but **Fixed background** does not necessarily have to be turned on. Feel free to play around with these options to find what suits your needs.

#### [Focal point picker](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#focal-point-picker)

![Focal point picker for the cover image](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/cover-block-focalpoint.png)Focal point picker for the cover image

If the fixed background option is turned off, you will see the focal point picker. This tool lets you identify the main point of interest in the photo and highlight. Click on the picker to drag it to the spot you want, or use the left and top position percentages below to set it manually.

The clear media button removes the media and any changes you have to it.

#### [Resolution](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#resolution)

Cover block has been enhanced with new image resolution controls. You now have access to Resolution dropdown when selecting either a Featured Image, existing image from Media Library or uploading new image. This dropdown allows you to choose from available image sizes such as Thumbnail, Medium, Large and Full Size, helping you optimize for performance and visual quality.

#### [Featured Image](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#featured-image)

#### [Background Image](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#background-image)

#### [Alternative text](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#alternative-text)

The alternative text field allows you to add an alternative text for the cover image.

### [Color](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#color)

![The color settings for the cover block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/10/image-8.png)

With the Color settings, you can customize the **Cover** block by adding text, background, and link colors. The color selections vary depending on your active theme.

You can also add a gradient color to the **Cover** block. To do that, transform the block into the Media & Text block. Click the Background option and select the Gradient tab. Choose a color from the list. Convert the Media & Text block back into the **Cover** block.

[Learn more about the Color settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/)

### [Filter options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#filter-options)

The Filters section contains the Apply duotone filter option. So, you can enable the duotone filter from the block settings panel

[Read more about the filter options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/filters-settings-overview/).

### [Dimensions](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#dimensions)

The **Cover block** provides dimension settings options to add padding and margin.

For details refer to this support article: [Dimension settings overview](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/dimension-controls-overview/)

![Dimension setting for the cover block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/cover-block-dimensions.png)Dimension setting for the Cover block

### [Typography](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#typography)

The Typography settings enable you to customize the font and text appearance of the content within the **Cover** block. The settings have various options, such as font size, font style, font family, and letter spacing.

For details refer to this support article: [Typography settings overview](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/)

### [Advanced](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/cover-block/\#advanced)

The **Advanced** tab lets you add HTML anchor and CSS class(es) to your block.

![Advanced settings for the Cover block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/cover-block-advanced.png)Advanced settings for the Cover block

**HTML element** lets you choose between these HTML elements: Div, header, footer, main, section, article, and aside. It will default to div if another option isn’t selected. While more advanced, this option allows you to add semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page. For example, if you’re using the Cover block as part of your Header, it would make sense to define it as such.

**HTML anchor** allows you to [make a unique web address](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-jumps/) for a particular **Cover block**. Then, you’ll be able to link directly to a **Cover block** of your page.

The **Additional CSS class(es)** lets you add CSS class(es) to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
