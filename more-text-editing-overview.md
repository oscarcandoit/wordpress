## [Clear unknown formatting](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-text-editing-overview/\#clear-unknown-formatting)

In certain situations, you may come across an option in the block toolbar to _Clear unknown formatting_. This option will only appear if WordPress detects unrecognized formatting in a block. Choosing the _Clear unknown formatting_ option will remove any unrecognized code that is affecting your content. That said, It is not necessary to clear the unknown formatting in order to apply other rich text editing.

For example, the _Clear unknown formatting_ option might appear when you have copied and pasted content from a document editor such as Google Docs or Microsoft Word, or if you have used the _Edit as HTML_ option in the [More options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/) menu.

[![the user is mousing over the Clear Unknown Formatting option in the block toolbar. The text that is selected says 'This text was copied in to WordPress from another location and has some unusual formatting applied.' and it is italicised.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53484448/240368109-1c4594a5-6418-45f2-b800-75e96843636a.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53484448/240368109-1c4594a5-6418-45f2-b800-75e96843636a.png)
