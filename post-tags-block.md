[Go to the List of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

Use the _Tags block_ to display the posts’ tags. This block is primarily inside a single post template or nested inside a [Query Loop](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/query-loop-block/) block and helps to customize the appearance of the query loop.

To add a Tags block, click the **Block Inserter** icon when editing the page template. Search for the Tags **block**. Click on it to add the block to your page template.

You can also type /tags and hit enter to add the Tags block quickly.
