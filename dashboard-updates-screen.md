The **Dashboard Updates Screen**
provides the links necessary to install a ‘core’ WordPress upgrade
automatically, or to download the file necessary to complete a manual
upgrade.

In addition to the ‘core’ update process, this Screen provides
the ability to upgrade all plugins and themes, active or inactive, that
have available updates. For installs that have set the language to a
language different from English (United States), you can also install
translation updates.

## [Troubleshooting](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/dashboard-updates-screen/\#troubleshooting)

**Problem:** If one of the following messages is received after electing to do the Automatic Upgrade:

_Downloading update ._

_Download failed.: Could not open handle for fopen() to latest wordpress._

_I_ n _stallation Failed_

or

_Download failed.: name lookup timed out_

_Installation Failed_

**Solution:** Confirm you are properly connected to the internet then do the Automatic Upgrade again.

**Problem:** After doing the upgrade, and received _WordPress upgraded successfully_ message, but the following message still displays:

_An automated WordPress update has failed to complete – please attempt the update again now._

**Solution:** Delete the **.maintenance** file found in the WordPress root/base folder, then do the Upgrade again.

**Problem:** After clicking on “automatic upgrade” you get a dialog box asking for “Connection Information.” And, no matter what you enter, you continue to get errors.

**Solution:** Make sure that your entire wordpress directory is owned by the username under which your Apache server runs. For example, if your server runs as https, and your files live in /var/wordpress do a “chown -R apache.apache /var/wordpress.” Note that you might want to edit some permissions for security purposes, in particular a chmod 640 on wp-config.php, to protect access information to your database.
