_**Goal**: you will know what a Static Front page is, and you will be able to set up a Static Front Page on your WordPress site._

_**Pre-requisites**: you need to know the difference between [Pages](https://wordpress.org/support/article/pages/) and Post_.

## [What is a Static Front Page](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/create-a-static-front-page/\#what-is-a-static-front-page)

By default, WordPress displays a list of _Posts_ on the home page of your site. This list of posts is _automatically updated_ as soon as new posts are published, thus this is not static. Also, there is no need to create any page in order to have WordPress displaying this list of posts.

A Static Front Page is **a specific Page** used as _the Home Page_ of the site.

## [How to create a Static Front Page](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/create-a-static-front-page/\#how-to-create-a-static-front-page)

_Reminder: to create a page, go to **Pages > Add New**_

1. **Home Page**: (if not already created) create **the Page you want to use** as the Static Front (Home) Page.
2. **Posts Page**: (if not already created) create an **empty page**. Give it **a title** that will be used on top of your posts list. **This step is mandatory** as you are modifying WordPress default setting. _Any other content other than Title will not be displayed_ at all on this specific page.
3. **Setting**: go to **Settings > Reading**, then ‘Home page displays’.

1. Static Page setting: **select a static page** (instead of the default _Your latest posts_).
2. Home Page setting: in ‘Home page’ list, **select the page you want** for Static Front(Home) Page.
3. Posts Page setting: in ‘Posts page’ list, **select the empty page** you created. _Do not select any page with content_, as it will not be displayed.
4. **Save your settings** by clicking ‘Save Changes’ button.

Connect to your site home page: you should now see the Page you selected.
