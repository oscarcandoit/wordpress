The _Site Logo_ block lets you add a logo or image representing your website identity and help increase brand recognition. Unlike a site icon or a favicon, a logo is only visible on website pages like the home page.

_**Note:**_ The Site Logo block is primarily used when editing the Template files in the [Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/).

## [How to use the Site Logo block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-logo-block/\#how-to-use-the-site-logo-block)

To add a _Site Logo_ block, create a new page or open the Site Editor. Click the Block Inserter icon and search for the _Site Logo_ Block.

You can also type `/site-logo` and hit enter in a new paragraph block to add the _Site Logo_ block quickly.

To use the site logo image as the site icon in browser tabs, bookmark bars, and WordPress mobile apps, access the _Site Logo_ block settings panel and enable the Use as site icon option. It automatically set the image in the _Site Logo_ block as the site icon.

WordPress blocks have specific configuration options in the block settings panel. To access the _Site Logo_ block settings panel, click the Settings button at the top-right corner of the editor. Moreover, the _Site Logo_ block settings panel is divided into two tabs – **Settings** and **Styles**.

### [Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-logo-block/\#settings)

The **Settings** tab has several options as follows:

**Media**

![Add site logo to media gallery - block settings view before media is added](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/02/image.png)The “add media” button to insert a site logo![Add or replace site logo in the media gallery - block settings view](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/02/image-1.png)Options to replace the site logo

The media settings allows you to add an image to the _Site Logo_ block. Here are the steps you can do with this settings:

1. Click Add media to add an image to the _Site Logo_ block.
2. Once an image has been added, click the image name to update the image.
3. You have three options to do so: select an image from the media library, upload a new image, or remove the image by resetting the media.

**Settings**

![The block settings options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/settings.png)

Change the image width using the slider or typing a numeric value in the text field next to the slider.

Enable the **Link image to home** option to make a hyperlink to your website’s home page. This option is turned on by default.

Turn on the **Open in new tab** option to automatically open the home page in a new tab when the site logo image is clicked.

Activate the **Use as site icon** option to set the site logo image as the site icon. A site icon is a small image next to the site title in a web browser tab.

Note that this option is only available after you add an image to the _Site Logo_ block.

**Advanced**
