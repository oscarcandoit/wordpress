[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

Headings help to introduce new sections and organize the content on the page. They make your website more readable by humans and search engines.

To add a heading, click on the **Block Inserter** ( **+**). Alternatively, you can type `/heading` in a new paragraph block and press `enter`.

You can also add a Heading block with **H1** heading level by typing `/h1` in a new paragraph block followed by `enter`. Subsequent heading blocks can be added by typing `/h2`, `/h3`, `/h4`, `/h5`, `/h6` followed by `enter`.

The Block editor by default considers the page title as the <h1> tag, so subsequent **Heading** blocks are added as **H2**, **H3**, and so on.

You can also choose your heading level according to your style from the Block Toolbar.

Another shortcut method to add a heading is to type `##space` to add **H2** heading, `###space` to add **H3** heading, etc.
