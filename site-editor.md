The Site editor allows you to design the entire site including the header, footer, and everything in between, with [blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/). It gives you greater control over how your site looks.

The Site Editor is **only** available when you install and activate a [Block theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/) on your site.

## [How to access the Site editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/\#how-to-access-this-feature)

To work with the Site editor, you need to use a [block theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/) on your site. A block theme is a theme that uses [blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/) for all parts of a site, including navigation menus, header, content, and site footer.

All [blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/) that are available in the [WordPress Block editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/) can be used in the Site editor. A set of blocks called [Theme blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/#theme-blocks) are specifically built for the Site editor.

To find block themes, from the WordPress dashboard, go to **Appearance** \> **Themes** and click **Add New**. In the **Add Themes** page, select **Block Themes** to find the growing list of [Block themes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/) in the [WordPress theme directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/).

![Appearance > Themes showing block theme options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/01/Appearance-Themes-showing-block-themes-1024x517.png)How to find a block theme

Once you install and activate a Block theme on your site, go to **Appearance** \> **Editor** to open the Site Editor.

![Appearance section of the admin interface showing the Themes and Editor entry points after activating a block theme. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2023-03-27-at-6.23.05-PM.png)Appearance menu after activating a block theme

## [Things to do in the Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/\#how-to-access-this-feature-2)

Once you enter the Site Editor, you will see five menu items.

![Main menu screen in the Site Editor.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/Site-Editor-sections-6-3.png)

- [Navigation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor-navigation): Allows you to browse your menus and make basic changes.
- [Styles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/): Provides a direct access to edit your site’s style variations.
- [Pages](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor-pages): You can now edit the content of your pages inside the Site Editor itself.
- [Templates](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/): Review the different default layouts for the different sections on your site, as well as custom pages (search results, 404, etc).
- [Patterns](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor-patterns): Your Synced patterns and template parts can be managed here.

You will also see an icon of a magnifying glass. Click on it to access the [Command Palette.](https://wordpress.org/support/article/site-editor-command-palette)

Below is an overview of the different sections in the Site Editor.

## [The Site Editor workspace](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/\#how-to-use-the-site-editor)

The Site editor loads the home page of your site (based on what you have set in the [Reading Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-reading-screen/#reading-settings)) to start editing.

The top menu in the Site editor includes the following options:

![Site editor toolbar with numbers indicating various options to explore. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/Site-Editor-Toolbar.png)

1. The site icon (or the W icon, if no site icon is set for the site): Return to the dashboard or switch to the other section of the Site Editor: [Navigation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor-navigation), [Styles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/), [Pages](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor-pages), [Templates](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/), or [Patterns](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor-patterns). If you choose to return to the dashboard, it will prompt you to save the changes or leave the Site editor without saving the changes.

2. The **+** Block inserter button: Add a new [block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/), [block pattern](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-pattern/), Media, or synced pattern (if the site has synched patterns) to the Site editor.

4. Undo **:** Undo the most recent action taken.
5. Redo **:** Redo an action you reversed using the **Undo** button.
6. [List View](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/list-view/): See a list of all of the blocks that are on the page and easily navigate between the blocks on your page. This is useful for seeing the page’s structure and editing, moving, and removing blocks.
7. [Command Palette](https://wordpress.org/support/article/site-editor-command-palette): Click here to access all your site’s content, templates, and patterns quickly, as well as invoking other actions (settings, new page, etc).

   - You can choose to save all or just some of them.
   - Note that some changes (like changes to the Header and Footer templates) will apply to all pages of your site that use those templates, and not just the page you were working on.

9. Settings: Show or hide the Template and Block Settings sidebar menu.

10. [Styles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/) **:** Browse style variations available for the theme you have, set the typography, color palettes, and layout for the entire site, or customize the appearance of specific blocks for the whole site.
11. More Options **:** Click the three vertical dots icon to open additional settings and tools.

![Site editor with an arrow pointing to the three dot menu where extra settings can be found. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/Site-Editor-More-options-432x1024.png)

**View top toolbar**: Display or hide the top toolbar in the editor. When you enable this option, block toolbars are pinned to the top of the WordPress block editor (right under the top toolbar) instead of appearing directly above the block.

![Top toolbar enabled](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-12-at-9.58.33-PM-1024x219.png)Top toolbar enabled

**Spotlight mode**: All blocks are greyed out except for the one you’re working on so that you can focus on a single block at a time.

![Spotlight mode](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-12-at-10.01.48-PM-1-1024x722.png)Spotlight mode

**Plugins**: Here, you can switch between **Settings** and **Styles** in the Site editor Sidebar.

**Tools**: Here, you can download your theme with the updated templates and styles ( **Export**), learn [keyboard shortcuts](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-editor-keyboard-shortcuts/), visit the Site Editor welcome guide, copy all blocks, or view additional support articles.

**Preferences**: Use the [Preferences](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preferences-overview/) menu to customize the editing experience and change how you interact with blocks.

## [How to use the Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/\#how-to-use-the-site-editor-2)

### [To edit the site’s styles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/\#to-edit-the-sites-styles)

You can use the Site Editor to customize the styles for the entire website and for the blocks. Styles settings are available regardless of what template or template part you are editing.

In the **Styles** section, you can browse the style variations available for the theme you have, change the color palettes and typography, and layout across the entire site and also change the appearance of blocks which are also applicable across the whole site.

### [To customize the site’s layout](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/\#to-customize-the-sites-layout)

You can use the Site Editor to build the structure and layout of your entire site, using blocks. Eg: areas like headers, footers, and the structural appearance of your site’s posts and pages.

All [blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/) that are available in the [WordPress Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/) can be used in the Site Editor. A set of blocks called [Theme blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/#theme-blocks) are specifically built for the Site Editor.

The following tools are helpful when using the Site Editor.

### [The Command Palette](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/\#the-command-palette)

### [Copy and paste styles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/\#copy-and-paste-styles)

With WordPress 6.2, a new option was added to allow you to copy and paste block styles, making it easy to reuse designs you’ve created. You can find this from the three dot menu in any block and it’s meant to be used to copy and paste between the same type of block:

### [Apply style changes globally](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/\#apply-style-changes-globally)

If you’re more comfortable with more advanced options when creating a design or customizing individual blocks, as of WordPress 6.2, you can take changes made to an individual block and apply it to **all blocks of the same type**. For example, you could apply a single design for an individual block to all blocks in your site with a new option under the **Advanced** section of block settings.

![How to apply the current's block style to all styles of that same type across your site by clicking on Block Settings > Advanced > Apply Globally](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/site-editor-apply-styles-globally-1024x593.png)

When you’re in the Site Editor, you might want to change the preview of the template or template part you’re viewing. You can do this by selecting the handles of the dark gray sidebar and moving it to your liking.
