[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

Screencast is a digital recording of your computer screen. It usually includes audio narration and is a different type of instructional video.

With the [Screencast](https://www.techsmith.com/screencast.html) Embed block, you can add Screencast videos on your posts/pages. You need a Screencast account to embed a video.

**Steps to embed a Screencast video to your post or page:**

1. Create and upload a Screencast video in your [Screencast](https://app.screencast.com/) account and copy the URL of the video.

2. Add a Screencast embed block to your post or page

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)

3. Paste the link into the textbox. Press the “Embed” button.

If the link can be successfully embedded into the post/page, you will see the preview in your block editor.

If you use a URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message “Sorry, this content could not be embedded.” You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or convert to link.

**Transform to**

You can transform a Screencast embed to a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the Screencast embed.
