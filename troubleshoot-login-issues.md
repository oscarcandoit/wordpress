If you are having trouble logging in to your WordPress [Administration Screen](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administration-screens/), here are some possible solutions.

## [Password Problems](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/troubleshoot-login-issues/\#password-problems-1)

For information on problems logging in due to a wrong or lost password, see [Resetting Your Password](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/resetting-your-password/). Remember: the Username and Password fields are **case-sensitive**.

## [Enable Cookies](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/troubleshoot-login-issues/\#enable-cookies-1)

In order to make sure that cookies are enabled for your browser, you need to:

1. Clear your browser cookies.
2. Clear your browser cache.

To see how to clear cookies and caches on various browsers, visit [Clearing Cache and Cookies](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?hl=en&rd=2).

## [Check your Firewall](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/troubleshoot-login-issues/\#check-your-firewall-1)

Some firewalls (e.g., eTrust Personal Firewall) block you from logging in to WordPress. Disable your firewall and try to log in again.

## [If All Else Fails](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/troubleshoot-login-issues/\#if-all-else-fails-1)

If these steps fail, please indicate that you have tried all these possible solutions when posting at the [WordPress Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/).

Be sure to give [details of your server setup](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/finding-server-info/), if you know it, including MySQL and PHP versions, as well as your operating system (OS), browser, and the WordPress version that is causing these problems.
