[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The **Post Author** blockdisplays the username of the post’s author. This block is primarily nested inside a [query loop](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/query-loop-block/) block and helps to customize the appearance of the query loop. This block is a part of the [Post Author block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-author-block/) but exists on its own for deeper customization.

You can insert this block elsewhere by clicking the **Add block** icon to open the block inserter pop-up window and search for the Post Author Name block. You can also type `/Post Author name` and hit `enter` in a new paragraph block to add one quickly.

Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/).

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-author-name-block/\#block-toolbar)

Each block has its own toolbar, which contains unique controls that let you customize or configure the block. The Post Author block has the following options on its toolbar:

**Transform to**

If you click the **Post Author** icon on the toolbar, you’ll open the **Transform to** options to convert the block into **Columns**, **Group**, and **Post Author Name** blocks.

**Block moving tools**

The **Drag** button lets you drag and drop the Post Author block and reposition it anywhere on the editor, while the **Move up** and **Move down** buttons let you move the Post Author block up or down on the editor.

If the Post Author is inside a row block, the **Move up** and **Move down** buttons are replaced by the **Move left** and **Move right** buttons to move the Post Author block inside the row block.
