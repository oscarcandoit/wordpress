[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

_Grid_ block is one of the container blocks that can be used to organize multiple blocks and adjust the height, width, and position of all blocks inside the container. As a container block, it’s possible to transform a _Grid_ block into a _Group_, _Row_ or _Stack_ block without changing the content of the block.

Click the block inserter **(+)** icon to open the block inserter pop-up window and search for the _Grid_ block. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `/grid` to quickly insert a Grid block.

Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/).

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/grid-block/\#block-toolbar)

To view the block toolbar, click on the block, and the toolbar will be displayed.

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons. These block-specific controls allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The Grid block shows the following buttons in the block toolbar:
