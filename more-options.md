The **More options** menu in the block toolbar gives you additional options to customize your block. You can access these additional options by clicking on the ellipses (three dots) in the block toolbar.

## [Copy](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/\#copy)

![You can use the Copy option to copy your block and paste it elsewhere on a post/page.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/12/more-options-copy-1.png)

Use the **Copy** option to copy a selected block and paste it elsewhere in the editor or even on a different post/page. When you select the **Copy** option, the block will be copied to your clipboard. Then, you can use Ctrl + V (Command + V) to paste it anywhere on your post/page or other posts/pages.

## [Cut](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/\#cut)

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/12/more-option-cut-1024x563.jpg)

Use the **Cut** option to cut a selected block and paste it elsewhere in the editor or even on a different post/page. When you select the **Cut** option, the block will be copied to your clipboard. Then, you can use Ctrl + V (Command + V) to paste it anywhere on your post/page or other posts/pages.

## [Duplicate](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/\#duplicate)

![You can use the Duplicate option to duplicate your block right below the original.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/12/more-options-duplicate.png)

The **Duplicate** option clones the selected block right below the original. If you want to duplicate a block to paste it to a different page or post, use the **Copy block** option instead.

## [Add before](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/\#add-before)

![Insert another block just before the current block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/12/more-options-add-before.png)

Use this option to insert a new block before the selected block(s). This option will create an empty line to add a new block above your current one.

## [Add after](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/\#add-after)

![Insert another block right after the current block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/12/more-options-add-after.png)

Use this option to insert a new block after the selected block(s). It creates an empty line for adding a new block below your current one.

## [Edit as HTML](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/\#edit-as-html)

Select Edit as HTML option and edit the HTML of the block.

The **Edit as HTML** option allows you to edit the block using HTML code. You can click on **Edit visually** to exit this mode, but the block editor might no longer recognize the original block, depending on your code changes.

## [Copy styles and Paste styles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/\#copy-styles-and-paste-styles)

Copy a block style and apply it on another block using the Paste style.

The **Copy styles** option copies all the style option to clipboard. You can go to another block and click **Paste styles** to apply the copied styles.

If you see a message like the one below, depending on what browser you are using, you may need to enable clipboard permissions in order to paste styles. :

![Unable to paste styles. Please allow browser clipboard permissions before continuing. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/More-options-6-3-clipboard-permissions-1024x99.png)Unable to paste styles. Please allow browser clipboard permissions before continuing.

Each browser handles this differently, but you may see a message similar to this:

![Browser pop-up asking if for permissions to let the website access the clipboard.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/More-options-6-3-clipboard-permissions-chrioe.png)website-name wants to: “See text and images copied to the clipboard”.

## [Lock](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/\#lock)

Use the **Lock** option to lock the selected block, which will prevent the block from being removed, moved, or both.

If you try to lock a [group block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/), you will see an option to also apply the same lock settings to all blocks nested inside.

## [Create pattern](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/\#create-pattern)

WordPress 6.3 renamed Reusable Blocks to Patterns. A synced pattern will behave in exactly the same way as a reusable block.

Save your block as a pattern so you can use them on other posts/pages

The Create [pattern/reusable block option](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reusable-blocks/) lets you add the selected block to a list of patterns, so you can use them on other posts or pages as well, and also remove a pattern from your list of patterns.

Optionally, you can set Synced option. Editing the synced pattern will update it anywhere it is used. After creating a synced pattern, you can detach it to a regular block, and edit the block without affecting your already saved synced pattern.

## [Group](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/\#group)

Creating a group block will allow you to handle all the nested blocks in one go

Select the **Group** option to group a collection of blocks and treat them as a unit. This is helpful if you want to, for instance, add a common background color to a collection of blocks. Also, you can **Ungroup** your blocks, if you don’t want them to be in a group. You can learn more about the Group block [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/).

## [Delete](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/\#delete)

![You can use the Delete option to delete a block from the content.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/12/more-options-delete.png)

With the **Delete** option, you can delete the selected block from your content.
