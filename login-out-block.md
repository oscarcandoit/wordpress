[Go to the list of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The **Login-out** block allows you to automatically add a link anywhere on your site which lets your site users login and/or logout if they are already logged in.

## [How to add the Login-out block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/login-out-block/\#how-to-add-the-login-out-block)

There are two ways you can use to add a **Login-out** block once you add a Navigation block:

- From the sidebar
- By typing forward slash ( **/**)

### [From the sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/login-out-block/\#from-the-sidebar)

Click on the ( **+**) icon in the sidebar, and either select the _Login-out link_ block from the list of your recently used blocks or click on _Browse all_ to show all the available blocks and select it from there.

### [By typing back slash (/)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/login-out-block/\#by-typing-back-slash)

Type back slash (/) on your keyboard and then start typing _login_. You should notice a small popup with suggestions. Select the _Login/out_ _block_ option from the popup itself.

Refer to this article for [detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/).

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/login-out-block/\#block-toolbar)

Each block has its own toolbar, which contains unique controls that let you customize or configure the block. The _Login/out_ block has the following options on its toolbar:

**Block moving tools**

![login-out block toolbar highlighting the drag tool](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/12/login-out-block-drag-n-drop-option.png)

You can reorder _Login/out block_ on the page. Use the toolbar to _move_ the items _top and_ bottom or _drag_ them to the line above or to the line below.

**More options**

The **Options** section opens block settings to update it. You can also _copy, duplicate, lock_, or _remove your Login/out_.

Details about **More options** can be found in this [support article](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/).

## [Block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/login-out-block/\#block-settings)

Each link has its **Block settings** you can access by clicking the **settings** button on the upper-right corner of the editor or via **Options** in the toolbar.

**Settings**

There are 2 options under settings for the _login/out_ block.

1. Display login as form.
   - This setting displays the login form instead of just showing the login link.
   - The logout link stays unchanged with this setting.
2. Redirect to current URL.
   - When this setting is enabled, the user after successful login lands to the previous URL he was trying to access before login.

**Typography**

The _Login/out_ block provides typography settings to change the font family, appearance, line height, letter spacing, decoration, letter case, and font size.

For details refer to this support article: [Typography settings overview](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/)

**Advanced**

The **Advanced** section has the **Additional CSS classes(es)** option. You can integrate your custom style into a _Login/out_ block by inserting your CSS Class name into this field.
