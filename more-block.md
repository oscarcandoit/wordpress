[Go to the List of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The _More block_ is used to display a ‘Read More’ link to the full blog post, on the blog home page, or on the archive pages.

If your theme is set to show the post’s full content on archive pages or the blog home page, then a post using the _More block_ truncates your blog entries so that only the part of the post before the _More block_ is displayed on the home page and archive pages, followed by a “Read More” link. Clicking on the ‘Read More’ link directs the reader to the full blog post.

If your theme is set to show only the excerpts on the archives page and the blog home page, the _More block_ is ignored. The excerpt displayed is the one [manually entered for the post](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/excerpt/).

The More block can be placed anywhere in a post. You can customize the link to say whatever you want. You can only insert one More block in each Post.

The More Blockworks only for Posts, (not Pages).

And this is how it will look on your site (Styles may vary depending on your theme).

To add a More block, click on the **Block Inserter** icon.

You can also type `/more` and hit enter in a new _paragraph block_ to add one quickly.

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)

**Editing the Block**

Once you add the block, you can edit the Read More text that appears by default by clicking in the middle of the dashed lines, erasing the text, and typing anything you want. To revert back to the default text that your theme displays, remove all the text from the More block and save your Post.

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-block/\#block-toolbar)

Each block has its own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor. The _More block_ offers the following buttons on the Block toolbar:

Transform to

Drag icon

Move handles

More options

[![Block toolbar in the More block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-8.49.10-AM-1024x150.png)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-8.49.10-AM.png) You can click on the block to reveal the Block Toolbar.

**Transform to**

Click on the “Transform” button to convert the More block into a “Columns” or “Group” block. “Group” gives you the ability to change the background color around the More block.

**Drag icon**

To drag and drop the block to a new location on the page template, click and hold the rectangle of dots, then drag to the new location. The blue separator line indicates where the block will be placed. Release the left mouse button when you find the new location to place the block.

**Move handles**

The up and down arrow icons can be used to shift a block up and down on the page.

**More options**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-block/\#block-settings)

Every block has specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar. _If you do not see the sidebar, simply click the ‘cog’ icon._

![Cog icon to display the Block sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-9.39.34-AM.png)

The Block Sidebar for the More block has a toggle switch to:

### [Hide the excerpt on a full content page](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-block/\#hide-the-excerpt-on-a-full-content-page)

[![Block Settings for More block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-9.09.16-AM-1.png)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-9.09.16-AM-1.png) Block Settings for More block

By enabling the ‘ _Hide the excerpt_‘ toggle button, the content that appears before the _More block_ will not display on the full post, once the user clicks on the _More_ link after the excerpt.

This option is disabled by default. This feature is helpful if you would like to display custom excerpt on the homepage and archive pages but when the user clicks to read the full post, the excerpt is hidden.
