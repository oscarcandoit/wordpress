[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

With the SoundCloud Embed block, you can embed tracks, playlists & albums from SoundCloud into your posts and pages. You don’t need a SoundCloud account to embed a track, playlist, or album, although the track needs to be public.

**Steps to embed a track from SoundCloud**

1. Find your track link on SoundCloud: In SoundCloud, select the track and click on the “Share” button.

3. Add a SoundCloud Embed block to your page/post by clicking on the **Block Inserter** icon. You can also type ` /SoundCloud` and hit enter in a new _paragraph block_ to add one quickly.

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)

4. Paste the track’s link into the text box.

5. Click the “Embed” button. If the link is successfully embedded you will see a preview in your editor.

If you use a URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message _“Sorry, this content could not be embedded”. You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or convert to a_ link.

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/soundcloud-embed/\#block-toolbar)

Each block has its own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor. The _SoundCloud Embed block_ has the following options in the Block toolbar.

- Transform to
- Block moving tools
- Change alignment
- Edit URL, and
- More options.

**Transform to**:

You can transform a _SoundCloud Embed block_ into a Paragraph, Columns, or a Group block.

![Transform option in the SoundCloud block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/171649646-0d9b5519-1706-47c7-a4a3-bee6e04788b2.png)

When you transform a SoundCloud embed to a Group block, you can change the background color around the SoundCloud embed.

**Change alignment**

“Wide width” and “Full width” alignment need to be enabled by the Theme of your site.

**Edit URL**

You can change the SoundCloud Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the “Embed” Button.

![Edit URL in the SoundCloud block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/171649704-70b546a0-1ec2-4458-8014-951ca9bd3d51-1024x437.png)

**More options**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/soundcloud-embed/\#block-settings)

**Media Settings**

![Media settings turned off in the SoundCloud block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-9.29.46-AM.png)![Media settings turned on in the SoundCloud block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-9.29.55-AM.png)

From the Media Settings, you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position, the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.

[![The advanced section lets you add a CSS class to your block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-22-at-10.33.35-AM.png)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-22-at-10.33.35-AM.png) The advanced section lets you add a CSS class to your block.
