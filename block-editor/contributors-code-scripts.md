## [Vendor scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/code/scripts/\#vendor-scripts)

The editor also uses some popular third-party packages and scripts. Plugin developers can use these scripts as well without bundling them in their code (and increasing file sizes).

| Script Name | Handle | Description |

| [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) | lodash | Lodash is a JavaScript library which provides utility functions for common programming tasks |

## [Polyfill scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/code/scripts/\#polyfill-scripts)

The editor also provides polyfills for certain features that may not be available in all modern browsers.

It is recommended to use the main `wp-polyfill` script handle which takes care of loading all the below mentioned polyfills.

| Script Name | Handle | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Babel Polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill) | wp-polyfill | Emulate a full ES2015+ environment. Main script to load all the below mentioned additional polyfills |
| [Fetch Polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whatwg-fetch) | wp-polyfill-fetch | Polyfill that implements a subset of the standard Fetch specification |
| [Promise Polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/promise-polyfill) | wp-polyfill-promise | Lightweight ES6 Promise polyfill for the browser and node |

## [Bundling and code sharing](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/code/scripts/\#bundling-and-code-sharing)

When using a JavaScript bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), the scripts mentioned here can be excluded from the bundle and provided by WordPress in the form of script dependencies see [`wp_enqueue_script`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/#default-scripts-included-and-registered-by-wordpress).

The [`@wordpress/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin) provides a webpack plugin to help extract WordPress dependencies from bundles. The `@wordpress/scripts` [`build`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/scripts#build) script includes the plugin by default.
