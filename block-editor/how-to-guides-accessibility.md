Accessibility documentation for developers working on the Gutenberg Project.

## Landmark regions

It is a best practice to include ALL content on the page in landmarks, so that screen reader users who rely on them to navigate from section to section do not lose track of content.

For setting up navigation between different regions, see the [navigateRegions package](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guide/components/higher-order/navigate-regions/) for additional documentation.
