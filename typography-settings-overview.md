You can use the typography settings in your [block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/) to change the font and appearance of your texts. These settings include font size, line height, font style, font weight, text transform, letter spacing, font family, and text decoration. When combined, they allow you to have new ways to differentiate your content.

The typography settings are available when you use the [block editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/). If you are new to the block editor, [this guide](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/working-with-blocks/) will show you how to work with blocks. You can read more about the new block editor features and improvements [in this article.](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/26/core-editor-improvement-catalyst-for-creativity/)

## [How to access typography settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/\#how-to-access-typography-settings)

The typography settings can be found in the Block Settings sidebar of a [block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/) under the section **Typography**.

If you don’t see the **Block Settings** sidebar, select the block you want to customize, then click the **settings** icon that is to the right of the **Publish** or **Update** buttons in the WordPress Editor.

In the **Typography** section, some options may be hidden. Click on the Typography options three-dot menu (also known as an ellipsis) to explore all the typography settings that are not visible by default.

**Displaying additional typography settings**

From the drop-down menu, select the typography setting that you want to add to the **Typography** section. You can add as many settings as you like.

The full list of the different types of settings is listed below.

If you make customizations to these settings and want to revert back to the original settings quickly, you can do so by selecting the three-dot menu icon and clicking **Reset All** as [shown in this article](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/working-with-blocks/#reset-controls). This resets the settings and removes all of your changes.

## [Type of settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/\#type-of-settings)

Every supported block comes with different typography settings.

### [Font family](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/\#font-family)

This option allows you to change the font family for your text, with a preview of the fonts available in the drop-down menu. The list of available fonts depends on your theme.

### [Font size](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/\#font-size)

![How to change measurement units for font size](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/typography-panel-size-units-WP-62.png)

You can change the unit of the font size by clicking the **px** icon on the right. You can choose between **px**, **em**, **rem**.

### [Line height](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/\#line-height)

This setting sets the spacing above and below each line of text within a given paragraph. The default line height for most themes is **1.5**. You can use the Line height settings to increase or decrease it to your liking. You can also add a custom number for the line height.

## [The difference between px, em, rem, %, vw, and vh units](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/\#units-explained)

Pixel ( **px**) is not a scalable unit, it is an absolute unit. The **px** unit does not change based on any other element and hence **px** units are not responsive. They are useful for maintaining consistent sizing for some elements. If you have elements that should not be resized, then using **px** unit is a good option.

Element ( **em**), root element ( **rem**), **%**, viewport height( **vh**) and viewport width( **vw**) are relative units. They are suited for responsive designs because these units scale up and down based on other elements size. They also get interpreted into the equivalent **px** unit by the browser.

**em**: Relative to the parent element

**rem**: Relative to the root element (HTML tag)

**%**: % relative to the parent element

**vw**: Relative to the viewport’s width

**vh**: Relative to the viewport’s height

## [Demonstration](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/\#demonstration)

To see the power of these settings in action, here’s an example of using them to personalize a button.
