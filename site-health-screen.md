Site Health screen is located in your dashboard under **Tools** > **Site Health** > **Info**.

WordPress offers a diagnosis of your site’s health. There are two tabs on the site health screen:

1\. Status:

The status tab allows you to see critical information about your WordPress configuration, along with anything else that requires your attention.

2\. Info:

The info tab is a granular view of the technical aspects of your WordPress website. You can see detailed information about every aspect of your site such as themes, plugins, and media. There is also a useful export feature that allows you to copy all of the information about your site to the clipboard.

Find more detailed information on both tabs below.

## [Status](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-health-screen/\#status)

The site health check shows critical information about your WordPress configuration and items that require your attention. Information is grouped by severity: critical issues recommended improvements and passed tests.

### [Critical issues](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-health-screen/\#critical-issues)

Critical issues refer to parts of your website that can be potential security vulnerabilities or serious performance issues; suggesting how to fix them. Some of the possible critical issues are:

**Auto-updates for plugins and/or themes appear to be disabled, but settings are still set to be displayed.**

This could cause auto-updates to not work as expected.

Type: Security

[Learn more about auto-updates for plugins and themes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/plugins-themes-auto-updates/)

**Background updates are not working as expected.**

Background updates ensure that WordPress can auto-update if a security update is released for the version you are currently using.

[Configuring automatic updates](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/configuring-automatic-background-updates/) **Could not reach WordPress.org**

Communicating with the WordPress servers is required to check for new versions, and install and update WordPress core, themes, or plugins. This message means your site is unable to reach WordPress.org at api.wordpress.org

**File upload**

file\_uploads is set to 0. You won’t be able to upload files on your site.

The ini\_get() function has been disabled, some media settings are unavailable because of this.

**HTTP requests are blocked**

HTTP requests have been blocked by the WP\_HTTP\_BLOCK\_EXTERNAL constant, with no allowed hosts.

Site maintainers can now block all, or some, communication to other sites and services. If set up incorrectly, this may prevent plugins and themes from working as intended.

![Message: HTTP requests are blocked](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/image9.png)

**Your site is set to display errors to site visitors**

Debug mode is often enabled to gather more details about an error or site failure, but may contain sensitive information which should not be available on a publicly available website.

The value, WP\_DEBUG\_DISPLAY, has either been enabled by WP\_DEBUG or added to your configuration file. This will make errors display on the front end of your site.

![Message: Your site is set to display errors to site visitors ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/image21.png)

**Your site is set to log errors to a potentially public file**

Debug mode is often enabled to gather more details about an error or site failure but may contain sensitive information which should not be available on a publicly available website.

The value, WP\_DEBUG\_LOG, has been added to this website’s configuration file. This means any errors on the site will be written to a file that is potentially available to all users.

[Learn more about debugging in WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/debugging-in-wordpress/)

**Your site could not complete a loopback request**

Loopback requests are used to run scheduled events and are also used by the built-in editors for themes and plugins to verify code stability.

![Message: Your site could not complete a loopback request](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/image14.png)

**PHP default timezone is invalid**

PHP default timezone was changed after WordPress was loaded. This interferes with the calculations of dates and times.

**One or more required modules are missing**

The required module, json\_last\_error, is not installed or has been disabled.

**An active PHP session was detected**

A PHP session was created by a session\_start() function call. This interferes with REST API and loopback requests. The session should be closed by session\_write\_close() before making any HTTP requests.

![Message: An active PHP session was detected](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/image16.png)

**Your site is running an outdated version of PHP, which requires an update**

PHP is the programming language used to build and maintain WordPress. Newer versions of PHP are created with increased performance in mind, so you may see a positive effect on your site’s performance

Type: Security

![Message: Your site is running an outdated version of PHP, which requires an update](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/image8.png)

**You have plugins waiting to be updated**

Plugins extend your site’s functionality with things like contact forms, eCommerce, and much more. That means they have deep access to your site, so it’s vital to keep them up to date.

![Message: You have plugins waiting to be updated](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/image4.png)

### [Recommended improvements](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-health-screen/\#recommended-improvements)

Recommended improvements section lists all the items that are not critical for your website but should be modified for better security and performance.

### [Passed tests](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-health-screen/\#passed-tests)

The passed tests section lists all the other items that are tested by the Site Health tool and showing no issues.

## [Info](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-health-screen/\#info)

The site health info screen contains details about the configuration of your WordPress site. For example, here you can find information on which version of WordPress you are using or the number of active and inactive plugins and themes you have. But, this screen also contains technical information about your server setup, your database, and your permissions. Note that the screen only contains information. So, you cannot configure any of the settings from it.
