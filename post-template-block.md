[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The **Post Template** block is a container block that is nested in the [Query Loop](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/query-loop-block/) block. This block contains inner block elements used to display a post in the Query loop block such as the post title, post content or excerpt, date, and featured image.

To find the **Post Template** block, click the **Block Inserter** icon, then search for the **Query Loop** block. Click on it to insert the block to the editor. Alternatively, you can type `/query-loop` to quickly insert the Query Loop block. Click **Choose** to open a selection of patterns. Use the arrow icons (at the bottom) to move from one pattern to another. Click on the **Choose** button to confirm the selection.

To have the **Post Template** block load only the posts from a specific category, [add a new template](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/#to-add-a-new-template) for that category in the [Template Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/) and enable the **inherit query** under the Query Loop block settings.

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-template-block/\#block-toolbar)

When users select a block, the block toolbar containing a number of control buttons will appear above the selected block. The **Post Template** block toolbar includes the following tools:

**Select query loop**

This button will select the Query Loop block, which is the **Post** **Template’s** parent block.

**Transform to**

Users can transform the **Post Template** block into a **Columns** or a **Group** block.

**Block-moving tools**

![Block moving tools in the Post Template block](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DrkI_6uKj0-P0LSC9sK6cc1vaAIjFPuSR6W7_VKmKUpgmtOvt5IVhrnk3GPk4yzHj5v8g6pLox8BTDHjVD6k-mBcXQp0fnKhZxH8KB8AyobZ22Lm6xmu3sl1YjH51qPBzV89EHZ9RL1j3V_66Eer6bFrFicQLAS0BGNskjlywFb_eQfgKJsmz3JharrEbA)

Use the block-moving tools to move the **Post Template** block. The six dots icon allows you to freely reposition the block anywhere within the editor by dragging and dropping it. You can also use the arrows icon to move the block up or down the editor.

**Change alignment**

![Change alignment in the Post Template block](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/aJuuJl0HhzNAQ-ZUpyPSxj-vyE-qeNOCuiEBTdWXDeVInbNRgJMcMwTt8N-pxz51D8TNvndZUqWyAP9K2e3njX7dHqiyu07lCDGfeMY4OGN08YIRqPy4ZoLcjfx3aH0hcJEBi65TPPZRVDoTsBquzztYlLFwca71F3USXlwrjuddYRvh0vHSXUSYmGVdQw)

Use the change alignment tool to reposition the **Post Template** block inside the Query Loop block. The following is a list of the block alignment options:

- None
- Wide width
- Full width
- Align left
- Align center
- Align right

When the parent Query Loop block’s Layout settings – **inner blocks use content width** option is enabled, the **Post Template** block will inherit the layout settings from the parent Query Loop block.

**More options**

The [More Options menu](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options) represented by **three vertical dots on the far right of the toolbar** gives you more features such as the ability to duplicate, remove, or edit your block as HTML.
