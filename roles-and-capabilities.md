WordPress uses a concept of [Roles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#roles), designed to give the [site](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#site) owner the ability to control what users can and cannot do within the site. A site owner can manage the user access to such tasks as [writing and editing posts](https://wordpress.org/support/article/writing-posts/), [creating Pages](https://wordpress.org/support/article/pages/), [creating categories](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Categories_SubPanel), [moderating comments](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Moderation), [managing plugins](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/), [managing themes](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-themes/), and [managing other users](https://codex.wordpress.org/Users_Screen), by assigning a specific role to each of the users.

WordPress has six pre-defined roles: [Super Admin](https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#super-admin), [Administrator](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#administrator), [Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#editor), [Author](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#author), [Contributor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#contributor) and [Subscriber](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#subscriber). Each role is allowed to perform a set of tasks called [Capabilities](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#capabilities). There are many capabilities including “ [publish\_posts](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#publish_posts)“, “ [moderate\_comments](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#moderate_comments)“, and “ [edit\_users](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#edit_users)“. [A default set](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#capability-vs-role-table) of capabilities is pre-assigned to each role, but other capabilities can be assigned or removed using the [add\_cap()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_cap) and [remove\_cap()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_cap) functions. New roles can be introduced or removed using the [add\_role()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_role) and [remove\_role()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_role) functions.

The [Super Admin](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#super-admin) role allows a user to perform all possible capabilities. Each of the other roles has a decreasing number of allowed capabilities. For instance, the [Subscriber](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#subscriber) role has just the “ [read](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#read)” capability. One particular role should not be considered to be senior to another role. Rather, consider that roles define the user’s responsibilities within the site.

## [Summary of Roles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/\#summary-of-roles)

- [Super Admin](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#super-admin) – somebody with access to the site network administration features and all other features. See the [Create a Network](https://wordpress.org/support/article/create-a-network/) article.
- [Administrator](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#administrator) ( _slug: ‘administrator’_) – somebody who has access to all the administration features within a single site.
- [Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#editor) ( _slug: ‘editor’_) – somebody who can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users.
- [Author](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#author)  ( _slug: ‘author’_)  – somebody who can publish and manage their own posts.
- [Contributor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#contributor) ( _slug: ‘contributor’_) – somebody who can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them.
- [Subscriber](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#subscriber) ( _slug: ‘subscriber’_) – somebody who can only manage their profile.

Upon installing WordPress, an Administrator account is automatically created.

The default role for new users can be set in [Administration Screens](https://wordpress.org/support/article/administration-screens/) \> [Settings](https://wordpress.org/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings) \> [General](https://wordpress.org/support/article/settings-general-screen/).

## [Roles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/\#roles)

A Role defines a set of tasks a user assigned the role is allowed to perform. For instance, the [Super Admin](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#super-admin) role encompasses every possible task that can be performed within a [Network](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#network) of virtual WordPress [sites](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#site). The [Administrator](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#administrator) role limits the allowed tasks only to those which affect a single site. On the other hand, the [Author](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#author) role allows the execution of just a small subset of tasks.

The following sections list the default Roles and their capabilities:

### [Super Admin](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/\#super-admin)

Multisite Super Admins have, by default, all capabilities. The following Multisite-only capabilities are therefore only available to Super Admins:

- [create\_sites](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#create_sites)
- [delete\_sites](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#delete_sites)
- [manage\_network](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#manage_network)
- [manage\_sites](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#manage_sites)
- [manage\_network\_users](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#manage_network_users)
- [manage\_network\_plugins](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#manage_network_plugins)
- [manage\_network\_themes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#manage_network_themes)
- [manage\_network\_options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#manage_network_options)
- [upgrade\_network](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#upgrade_network)
- [setup\_network](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#setup_network)

In the case of single site WordPress installation, Administrators are, in effect, Super Admins. As such, they are the only ones to have access to [additional admin capabilities](https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#additional-admin-capabilities).

### [Administrator](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/\#administrator)

The capabilities of Administrators differs between single site and [Multisite](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#multisite) WordPress installations. All administrators have the following capabilities:

### [Special Cases](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/\#special-cases)

The following capabilities are special cases:

- [unfiltered\_upload](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#unfiltered_upload) – This capability is not available to any role by default (including Super Admins). The capability needs to be enabled by defining the following constant:

```
define( 'ALLOW_UNFILTERED_UPLOADS', true );
```

With this constant defined, all roles on a single site install can be given the unfiltered\_upload capability, but only Super Admins can be given the capability on a Multisite install.

### [Capability vs. Role Table](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/\#capability-vs-role-table)

Note that the capabilities of Administrators **differs** between single site and [Multisite](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#multisite) WordPress installations, [as described above](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#additional-admin-capabilities) .
