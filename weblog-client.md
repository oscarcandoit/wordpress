A Weblog Client is software you run on your local machine (desktop) that lets you post to your blog via [XML-RPC](https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support). In some cases, the Weblog Client can even manage your weblog entries. You might think of Weblog Clients as the equivalent of email clients. Essentially, the Weblog Client allows you to write a post even if you are off-line; then, the next time you connect to the Internet, you can publish that post.

For information on blogging by email, see [Blog by Email](https://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_by_Email).
