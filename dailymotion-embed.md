Dailymotion is a video-sharing platform. Using the _Dailymotion Embed_ block includes a Dailymotion video into your post/page with play buttons, so your visitor can stay on your site to watch it. You don’t need a Dailymotion account to embed posts.

## [Steps to embed a Dailymotion video in your post or page](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/dailymotion-embed/\#steps-to-embed-a-dailymotion-video-in-your-post-or-page)

1. Locate the video and copy the URL from Dailymotion.com in the browser bar

2. Add a Dailymotion Embed block to your post

3. Paste the video URL into the text box

4. Click the “Embed” button

If it’s a link that can be successfully embedded you will see a preview in your editor.

You’ll see your video in the block editor, with the option to write a caption underneath.

If you use a URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message “Sorry, this content could not be embedded.” You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or Convert to link.

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/dailymotion-embed/\#block-toolbar)

Besides the Mover and Drag & Drop Handle, the Block Toolbar for the Dailymotion embed shows four buttons:

- Transform to
- Change alignment
- Edit URL, and
- More Options.

**Transform to**:

![Options to transform the Dailymotion block to Paragraph, Columns or Group.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Dailymotion-HelpHub-SS-7.png)

You can transform a Dailymotion embed into a Paragraph, Columns, or Group. Transforming it into a Group would give you the ability to change the background color around the Dailymotion embed.

**Change alignment:**

![Alignment options for the Dailymotion block: wide width, full width, align left, align center, and align right.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Dailymotion-HelpHub-SS-10-2.png)

- Wide width – Increase the width of the post beyond the content size
- Full width – extend the Dailymotion post to cover the full width of the screen.
- Align left – Make the Dailymotion post left aligned
- Align center – Make the Dailymotion post alignment centered
- Align right – Make the Dailymotion post align right

_“Wide width” and “Full width” alignment need to be enabled by the Theme of your site._

**Edit URL**:

Via the edit URL, you can change the Dailymotion Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the “Embed” Button.

![Editing the Dailymotion block URL via the "edit" option.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Dailymotion-HelpHub-SS-11.png)

**More options**

The More Options menu represented by three vertical dots on the far right of the toolbar gives you more features such as the ability to duplicate, remove, or edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/dailymotion-embed/\#block-settings)

Besides the Advanced section, the Dailymotion embed has only one other setting in the “Block Settings” sidebar: Media Settings.

### [Media Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/dailymotion-embed/\#media-settings)

![Media settings for the Dailymotion embed block with the toggle OFF for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Dailymotion-HelpHub-SS-16.png)

![Media settings for the Dailymotion embed block with the toggle ON for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Dailymotion-HelpHub-SS-15-1.png)

Via the _Media Settings_ you can control the behavior of your embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position, the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The “Advanced” tab lets you add CSS class(es) to your block.

![Additional CSS Class(es) option for the Dailymotion Embed block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Dailymotion-HelpHub-SS-17-1.png)

The “Additional CSS class(es)” lets you add CSS class(es) to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
