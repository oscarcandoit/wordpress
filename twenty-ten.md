The [Twenty Ten](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyten/) is the default theme for WordPress in 2010, introduced with [WordPress version 3.0.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/wordpress-version/version-3-0/)

It is stylish, customizable, simple, and readable. Twenty Ten supports six widgetized areas (two in the sidebar, four in the footer) and featured images (thumbnails for gallery posts and custom header images for posts and pages). Twenty Ten has editor styles, one and two- column page templates, and supports Aside and Gallery post formats.

Twenty Ten was created by [Ian Stewart](https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandstewart/) and [Matt Miklic](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mattmiklic/), based on the theme “Kirby”.

## [Customizing](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-ten/\#customizing)

There are a few ways that you can customize Twenty Ten, either from the [Customizer](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/customizer/) or through the WordPress admin screen. This short guide will use the Customizer to:

- Change the custom header
- Add a custom background

### [Change the Custom Header](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-ten/\#change-the-custom-header)

The theme has eight header images to choose from, and you can add your own image.

To change you custom header, go to **Appearance > Customize**. Navigate to the link named “Custom Header” and click on the link.

![The Customizer Header Image panel with the default image selected.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/04/twentyten-customheader.png)

Click either

- the “Hide image” button to remove any custom header image in your theme,
- the “Add new image” button to upload your own image for your theme’s header area, or

After you’ve changed the header image, click on the “Save and Publish” button at the top of the customizer and wait till the text in the button changes to “Saved”.

Click on the “X” at the top of the Customizer to close the panel.
