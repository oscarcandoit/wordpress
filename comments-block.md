[Go to the list of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/support/article/blocks/)

The _Comments_ block is an advanced block that displays post comments with various visual configurations. It contains multiple blocks to show comments, such as [Comments Title](https://wordpress.org/support/article/comments-title-block/), [Comment Template](https://wordpress.org/support/article/comment-template-block/), [Comment Pagination](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comment-pagination-block/), and [Post Comments Form](https://wordpress.org/support/article/post-comments-form-block/). With the Comments block, adding a comment section to your posts becomes effortless.

To add the _Comments_ block, open the block inserter by clicking the ( **+**) icon on the upper left corner of the editor. After that, look for Comments using the search bar and click it to insert the block into the editor.

Alternatively, you can type `/comments ` on the editor to insert the _Comments_ block manually.

Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/adding-a-new-block/).

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comments-block/\#block-toolbar)

Most blocks have their own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The _Comments Block_ shows the following buttons:

- Transform to
- Moving handles
- Change alignment
- More options

### [Transform to](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comments-block/\#transform-to)

The Transform to button lets you change the _Comments_ block into a Columns or a Group block.

### [Moving handles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comments-block/\#moving-handles)

![The block moving tools on the Comments block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image6.png)

The dotted icons can be used to drag and drop a block to the place of your choosing. The up and down arrow icons can be used to shift a block up and down in your document.

### [Change alignment](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comments-block/\#change-alignment)

You can modify the alignment of the _Comments_ block using this tool. Click on the icon and select one of the following alignment options:

When you transform the _Comments_ block into a Columns block, the toolbar will show an additional tool called Change vertical alignment with three options:

- **Align top** – makes the block top-aligned.
- **Align middle** – lets you align the block to the center.
- **Align bottom** – makes the block right-aligned.
