[Go back to the list of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The _Paragraph_ block is a basic building block that allows you to add text content to a post or page. It is the default block that appears when you create a new post or page.

Besides adding text, the _Paragraph_ block offers various formatting options to customize text content. It lets you make the text bold, italics, and strikethrough. Additionally, you can add links, inline images, and highlights to the text content.

The _Paragraph_ block also supports keyboard shortcuts for text formatting, making creating and customizing content easier. For example, you can convert texts into headings using keyboard shortcuts: **Alt + Shift + Number 1-6**. The numerical keyboard shortcuts represent Heading 1 to Heading 6. If you want to change them back to texts, press **Alt + Shift + 0**.

[Learn more about the text formatting keyboard shortcuts.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/keyboard-shortcuts-block-editor/#text-formatting)

To add a _Paragraph_ block, create a new post or page and open the Block Inserter tool. Look for the _Paragraph_ block using the search bar and click on the icon to insert the block into the editor.

You can also choose the _Paragraph_ block from the “Block Inserter” (+) pop-up window when you click on the (+) sign.
