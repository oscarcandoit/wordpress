[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

Vimeo is a popular video-sharing service. With the Vimeo block, you can embed videos from Vimeo into your WordPress website. You don’t need a Vimeo account to be able to use it. You can only embed all public Vimeo videos.

When embedded, a Vimeo video would look like this inside your WordPress post or page.

**Embedded Vimeo Video**:

**Steps to Embed a Vimeo Video**:

**1\. Find the URL of the Vimeo video**

Find your video on vimeo.com, and copy the URL of the video from the browser bar.

**2\. Add a Vimeo Embed block to your post**

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)

**3\. Paste the Vimeo URL _from Step 1_**

![Paste the video link into the text box.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/2022-02-21_22-36-30-1024x637.png)

**4\. Click the _Embed_ button**

If it’s a link that can be successfully embedded you will see a preview in your editor.

![Preview of the vimeo  Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/2022-02-21_22-38-30-1.png)

If you use a URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message _“Sorry, this content could not be embedded.”_

![Error message when you cannot embed a URL in the SoundCloud block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/2022-02-21_22-43-04-1-1024x684.png)

You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or convert to link.

**5\. You’ll see the Vimeo player on your WordPress editor if you successfully embed a Vimeo video**

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/vimeo-embed/\#block-toolbar)

Besides the Mover and Drag & Drop Handle, the Block Toolbar for Vimeo embed shows four buttons:

- Transform to
- Change alignment
- Edit URL, and
- More Options

![Block toolbar in the vimeo video block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/154611389-012a95a5-dabb-448a-8323-ba52144952be-1.png)

**Transform to**

![Transform option in the vimeo block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/154611481-81e9e9fd-f127-4b55-989d-facf2a5701ad-1.png)

You can transform a Vimeo embed block into a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the Vimeo embed.

- **None**– Default alignment option.

- **Full width** – Extend the block to cover the full width of the screen.

**Edit URL**

Via the **Edit URL**, you can change the Vimeo Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the **Embed** button.

**More options**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/vimeo-embed/\#block-settings)

![Block settings for the vimeo block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/03/image3-edited-3.png)

Besides the Advanced section, the Vimeo embed has only one setting in the “Block Settings” sidebar: Media Settings.

**Media Settings**

![Media settings turned off in the vimeo block and Media settings turned on in the vimeo block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/pasted-image-0-15-1.png)

Via the _Media Settings_, you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position, the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

![The advanced section lets you add a CSS class to your block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/image-77.png)

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit. For a Vimeo embed there are default CSS classes to allow for responsive handling of the embed when viewed on smaller devices like mobile phones.
