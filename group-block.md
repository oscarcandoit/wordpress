[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The _Group block_ allows you to group different blocks together and customize them to your liking, including setting custom background colors, spacing, and more.

![Group block with columns, heading, paragraph, image and button blocks.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/group_block_layout_with_columns-1024x588.png)Example of a Group block with columns, heading, paragraph, image and button blocks.

## [Adding a Group block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#adding-a-group-block)

To add a _Group block_, click on the **Block Inserter** icon.

![Adding the group block to a post or page](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/group_block_block_inserter.png)

You can also type `/group` and hit enter in a new paragraph block to add one quickly. **Row and Stack are also types of Group blocks**, they just have a different layout style by default.

### [Block variations](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#block-variations)

When the _Group block_ is created, you will find different variations to choose from: _Group, Row,_ and _Stack_

![Group variation picker](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-settings-variation-1024x328.png)

### [Converting multiple blocks to a Group block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#converting-multiple-blocks-to-a-group-block)

You can also create a group by selecting multiple blocks. Multiple blocks can be selected by dragging your mouse. You can also select multiple blocks by holding down the “shift” key and using your navigation arrows or clicking on multiple blocks. Once one or more blocks have been selected, you will notice that the group icons will appear. You can click on these icons or use the “more options” button to convert them into a single group, as seen in the video below:

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#block-toolbar)

Most blocks have their own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor. The _Group block_ offers standard block options as well as full-width and wide-width options, if the theme supports these alignment styles.

The _Group block_ shows three buttons in addition to the “Group” block icon.

- Moving handles
- Change alignment
- More options

### [Moving handles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#moving-handles)

![Moving handles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-move.png)

The up and down arrow icons can be used to shift a block up and down in your document.

Detailed instructions on moving a block within the editor can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/moving-blocks/).

### [Change alignment](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#change-alignment)

![Group block alignment](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-alignment-1024x400.png)

**None –** Is the default width, the same as the main content.

**Wide width** – Increase the width of the post beyond the content size.

**Full width** – Extend the block to cover the full width of the screen, if supported by your site’s theme.

### [More options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#more-options)

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Editing the block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#editing-the-block)

The nice thing about the _Group block_ is that you can add any other blocks inside the group block and create a layout of your own. To add blocks to the _Group block_, click on the inserter icon inside the _Group block_.

![Adding a new block inside an existing group block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-add-block-1024x434.png)

## [Adding content](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#adding-content)

Inside the Group block, you can add a columns block, cover block or any other available block to create the layout of your choice.

![Adding content to the group block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/group_block_layout_with_columns-1024x588.png)

The group block shown here has columns, heading, paragraph, image and button blocks.

Note that since the _Group block_ has the ability to embed other blocks, if you click specifically on one of the blocks, the settings in the sidebar will change according to the block you added to the _Group block_. For example, if you added an image inside the _Group block_, when you click on the image the sidebar will display the options from the Image block settings.

![Block settings and styles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-settings-icon.png)

Every block has specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar. If you do not see the sidebar, simply click the ‘ **Settings**‘ icon next to the Publish/Update button _._ Within the _Group block_ settings, you will see two tabs, one is for **general settings** and the other one is for **styles**.

## [Group block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#block-settings)

![Group Block Settings Sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-settings-layout.png)

### [Alignment](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#alignment)

There are three alignment options for the _Group block_:

- Default
- Row (Horizontal)
- Stack (Vertical)

![Group Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-group.png)![Group Block Settings (row)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-row-1.png)![Group Block Settings (stack)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-stack.png)

If you set a block to “Row”, you will see a number of new options to justify the items inside the row:

![horizontal alignment icons](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-row-justify-1024x376.png)

Items can be set to justify left, center, right or “space between items”. This last option will distribute the items inside the row to use all the available width. Additionally, by changing the “orientation” setting, you can have your items change from flowing horizontally to flowing vertically, as illustrated in the video below.

There is a second alignment option to specify how items should align vertically.

![Vertical alignment icons](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-row-vertical-alignment-1-1024x635.png)

This is useful when the items inside the row have different heights, as seen in the example below:

### [Layout and content width](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#layout-and-content-width)

This is an advanced option that allows you to add custom content widths to the overall _Group block_ for all blocks assigned to the center or wide columns. In many cases, you won’t need to use this option. When you toggle this option on, it allows the _Group block_ to inherit the options set by your theme. When it’s toggled off, you can customize to your liking.

[This article provides details about layout settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/layout-settings-overview/)

### [Position (sticky)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#position-sticky)

![Position: Sticky](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-settings-sticky.png)

The “Position” group setting allows you make a group block stick to the top of the viewport instead of scrolling, as seen in the demo below:

Please note that **only “top level” Group blocks can be set as sticky**. If a Group block is embedded inside any other block, the “Position” setting will not be available in the settings.

### [Advanced](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#advanced)

The “Advanced” tab lets you specify the HTML element used for the group and add HTML anchor & CSS class(es) to your block.

[![Advanced settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-settings-advanced.png)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-settings-advanced.png)

The **HTML Element** option allows you to select what HTML tag you want to use for that group. You can choose between the following tags:

- Div (default)
- Header
- Main
- Section
- Article
- Aside
- Footer

**HTML anchor** allows you to [make a unique web address](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-jumps/) for a particular “Group” block. Then, you’ll be able to link directly to a “Group” block of your page.

The **Additional CSS class(es)** area lets you add CSS class(es) to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.

## [Group block styles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#block-settings-2)

### [Color](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#color)

When the group block is selected, you can see the color settings in the sidebar. You can select the text, background, and link colors to your liking.

[See this guide for more information about changing colors.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/)

### [Border](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#border)

This option allows you to set a border around the Group block, including the color, the width, radius, and the style of the border.

[Learn more about border settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/border-settings-overview/)

### [Dimensions](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/\#dimensions)

The option to control block spacing and padding is enabled for the Group block. You can read more about these settings in the
