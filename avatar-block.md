[Go to the List of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

Use the _Avatar_ block to display the user’s profile picture on any post, page, or template. Although the block can be added anywhere, the most common use is in the single post template to display the author. Another use case is in the _Query Loop_ blockto include the post author’s avatar in the query.
