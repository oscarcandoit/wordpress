## [What Are Smileys?](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/\#what-are-smileys)

Smileys, also known as “emoticons”, are _glyphs_ used to convey emotions in your writing. They are a great way to brighten up posts. 🙂

Text smileys are created by typing two or more punctuation marks. Some examples are:

`;-)` is equivalent to 😉

`:-)` is equivalent to 🙂

`:-(` is equivalent to 🙁

`:-?` is equivalent to 😕

To learn more about emoticons and their history, see the [Wikipedia entry on Emoticons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticons).

### [Smileys are not Emoji](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/\#smileys-are-not-emoji)

Although smileys and emoji can both display smiley faces and such, emoji are a newer development and have a much wider range of images that can be displayed. (They are also created differently.) For more information on emoji and how to use them, see the [Emoji](https://codex.wordpress.org/Emoji) page.

## [How Does WordPress Handle Smileys?](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/\#how-does-wordpress-handle-smileys)

By default, WordPress automatically converts text smileys to graphic images. When you type `;-)` in your post you see 😉 when you preview or publish your post.

## [To Turn off Graphic Smileys](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/\#to-turn-off-graphic-smileys)

As of WordPress 4.3, the option to disable graphic smileys was removed from new installs. There is [a plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/keep-emoticons-as-text/) if you want to retain the option.

## [What Text Do I Type to Make Smileys?](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/\#what-text-do-i-type-to-make-smileys)

Smiley images and the text used to produce them\*:

| icon | text | text | full text | icon | full text |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🙂 | `:)` | `:-)` | `:smile:` | 😆 | `:lol:` |
| 😀 | `:D` | `:-D` | `:grin:` | 😳 | `:oops:` |
| 🙁 | `:(` | `:-(` | `:sad:` | 😥 | `:cry:` |
| 😮 | `:o` | `:-o` | `:eek:` | 👿 | `:evil:` |
| 😯 | `8O` | `8-O` | `:shock:` | 😈 | `:twisted:` |
| 😕 | `:?` | `:-?` | `:???:` | 🙄 | `:roll:` |
| 😎 | `8)` | `8-)` | `:cool:` | ❗ | `:!:` |
| 😡 | `:x` | `:-x` | `:mad:` | ❓ | `:?:` |
| 😛 | `:P` | `:-P` | `:razz:` | 💡 | `:idea:` |
| 😐 | `:|` | `:-|` | `:neutral:` | ➡ | `:arrow:` |
| 😉 | `;)` | `;-)` | `:wink:` | ![:mrgreen:](https://wordpress.org/documentation/wp-includes/images/smilies/mrgreen.png) | `:mrgreen:` |

_\\* In some instances, multiple text options are available to display the same smiley._

## [Troubleshooting Smileys](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/\#troubleshooting-smileys)

### [Why Doesn’t it Work?](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/\#why-doesnt-it-work)

Smileys may have been disabled by your WordPress admin. Another possibility is the smiley image files have been deleted from `/wp-includes/images/smilies`.

### [Why Doesn’t it Work for Me?](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/\#why-doesnt-it-work-for-me)

_If smileys work for others at your site but not for you:_

Type a space before and after your smiley text. That prevents the smiley being accidentally included in the text around it. 😳

Make sure not to use quotes or other punctuation marks before and after the smiley text. 🙄

### [Where Are My Smiley Images Kept?](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/\#where-are-my-smiley-images-kept)

The smiley or emoticon image graphics are found in the `/wp-includes/images/smilies` directory.

Note that smileys is spelled ‘eys’ in this documentation and the directory name for the smiley images is _‘smilies_, spelled ‘ies’. 😯

### [How Can I Have Different Smiley Images Appear?](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/\#how-can-i-have-different-smiley-images-appear)

The easiest way is to filter the smilies.

Upload the images you want with the same name to your server (say in wp-content/images/smilies) and put this in your theme’s function.php:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `add_filter( ` `'smilies_src'` `, ` `'my_custom_smilies_src'` `, 10, 3 );`<br>`function` `my_custom_smilies_src( ` `$img_src` `, ` `$img` `, ` `$siteurl` `)`<br>`{`<br>`        ``return` `$siteurl` `.` `'/wp-content/images/smilies/'` `.` `$img` `;`<br>`}` |

That will replace http://example.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon\_question.gif with http://example.com/wp-content/images/smilies/icon\_question.gif

### [Why are my Smiley Images Blank?](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/\#why-are-my-smiley-images-blank)

If you recently uploaded the images, it could be that the images have been uploaded in **_ASCII_** format by your FTP program. Re-upload the smileys ensuring that they are transferred in **_BINARY_** format.

Some FTP programs have an **auto-detect** setting which will upload files in the correct format without user intervention. If you have such a setting, turn it on.

## [Smiley CSS](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/\#smiley-css)

The smiley images in WordPress are automatically given a [CSS](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#CSS) class of **wp-smiley** when they are displayed in a post. You can use this class to style your smileys differently from other post images.

For example, it’s not uncommon to set up images in a post to appear on the left-hand side of the content with text flowing around the image. The CSS for that might look like this:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3 | `.post img {`<br>`        ``float: left;`<br>`}` |

This would typically affect all images in a post, **including** your smiley images. To _override_ this so that smileys stay inline, you could add this to your CSS:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3 | `img.wp-smiley {`<br>`        ``float: none;`<br>`}` |
