[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

With the VideoPress Embed block, you can embed videos from VideoPress into your posts and pages. You don’t need a VideoPress account to be able to embed them, although the video-sharing option should be enabled.

**Steps to embed a video from VideoPress**

1. Find the video permalink – In the web player, select the video and click on the **Share** button.

2. In the share section, click on the permalink and it will be automatically copied. Alternatively, you can highlight the link and copy it.

VideoPress provides you with three sharing options:

- Start at = true/false to exactly the time you want the video to start at.
- Loop = true/false to automatically play the video over and over.
- Autoplay = true/false to automatically play the video when it loads.

3. Add a VideoPress embed block to your page/post by clicking the **(+)** Block inserter icon.

4. Paste the link into the text box and click on the **Embed** button.

If it’s a link that can be successfully embedded you will see a preview in your editor.

If you use an URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message “Sorry, this content could not be embedded.” You will have two choices: **Try again** with a different URL or **Convert to link**.

**Transform to**

![Options to transform the VideoPress block to Paragraph, or Group.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/12/image13-1-1.png)

You can transform a VideoPress embed into a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the VideoPress embed.

## [Block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/videopress-embed/\#block-settings)

Besides the **Advanced** section, the VideoPress embed has only one setting in the **Block Settings** sidebar.

**Media**

![Media settings for the embed block with the toggle OFF/ON for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/image-76.png)

Via the **Media Settings**, you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**Off:** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the **Off** position, the toggle switch is gray.

**On:** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the **On** position.

**Advanced**

The **Advanced** tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
