[Go to the List of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The Embed block lets you add content from a third-party site to your post or page.

When you are embedding content, you don’t need to upload the content to your WordPress site. You are creating a link to the content, from within your post or page.

**Steps to embed content from a third-party site on your post or page**

1. Copy the URL from the [site you want to embed from](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/embeds/#list-of-sites-you-can-embed-from).
2. Add the Embed block by clicking on the + Block Inserter and searching for the Embed block.  Alternatively, you can use the slash command, `/embed` in a new _paragraph block_ then press `enter` to add one quickly.

3. Paste the URL from step 1 into the block.
4. Click on the “Embed” button.

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/embed-block/\#block-toolbar)

The block toolbar contains the tools to customize each block. The Embed Block’s toolbar consists of the following tools:

**Transform to**

![Transform tool in the Embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/05/image-1.png)

You can transform an Embed into a Paragraph, Columns, or Group block. Transforming to a Group block will let you change the background color around the Embed.

- **Full width** – extend the TED embed post to cover the full width of the screen.
- **Align left** – Make the TED embed post left aligned
- **Align center** – Make the TED embed post alignment centered
- **Align right**– Make the TED embed post align right

### [Edit URL](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/embed-block/\#edit-url)

Via the edit URL, you can change the Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the “Embed” Button.

### [Media Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/embed-block/\#media-settings)

![Media settings turned off](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/18-media_settings_disabled-1-2.jpg)![Media settings turned on](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/17-media_settings_enabled-2.jpg)

Via the _Media Settings_ you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
