- [**Google Product Feed – Feed item caching**](https://woocommerce.com/document/google-product-feed-feed-item-caching/)
Why “Feed item caching”? The aim of the Google Product Feed plugin is to produce an up-to-date, accurate feed of all of your eligible products. In order to achieve this, the plugin currently generates the feed on-demand as it is requested. This avoids any issues cause by out of date information being sent in the feed. \[…\]

- [**Google Product Feed – Installation**](https://woocommerce.com/document/google-product-feed-installation/)
Once you’ve installed the plugin we recommend you read our support articles on setting up your Google Merchant Centre account and setting product data.
