You can also use the keyboard shortcut `/search` to quickly insert a _Search block_.

Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/adding-a-new-block/).

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/search-block/\#block-toolbar)

To view the block toolbar, click on the block, and the toolbar will be displayed.

![Search block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/02/toolbar.png)

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons and blocks specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The _Search block_ shows standard eight buttons:

- Transform to
- Drag icon
- Move handles
- Change text alignment
- Toggle search label
- Change button position
- Use button with Icon
- More options

### [Adding placeholder text](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/search-block/\#adding-placeholder-text)

When you add a _Search block_, you have an option to add placeholder text inside the search field. The placeholder text is displayed until the user starts typing in a search term in the search field.

![Search block placeholder text](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/02/placeholder-text-3-1024x241.png)

### [Transform to](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/search-block/\#transform-to)

![Transform to option](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/02/transform-1.png)

When you click on the **Transform** button you can convert the _Search block_ into another block type while keeping the existing content.

Click on the **Transform** button to convert the Search block into a _Columns_ or _Group_ block. _Group_ block gives you the ability to change the background color around the _Search block_.

### [Drag icon](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/search-block/\#drag-icon)

![Drag icon on the search block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/02/drag-icon.png)

To drag and drop the block to a new location on the page template, click and hold the **drag** icon, then drag it to the new location. The blue separator line indicates where the block will be placed. Release the left mouse button when you find the new location to place the block.

### [Move arrows](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/search-block/\#move-arrows)

![Move arrows on the search block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/02/move-block-arrows.png)

The **up** and **down** arrow icons can be used to shift a block up and down on the page.

Detailed instructions on moving a block within the editor can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/moving-blocks/)

### [Change text alignment](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/search-block/\#change-text-alignment)

![Alignment tool on the search block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/02/alignment.png)

Use the change alignment tool to align the _Search block_. The following is a list of the block align options:

- None
- **Align left** – Make the block left-aligned.
- **Align center** – Make the block alignment centered.
- **Align right**– Make the block right aligned.

### [Toggle search label](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/search-block/\#toggle-search-label)

![Toggle search button on the search block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/02/toggle-search-label.png)

This button can be used to hide the search field label.

### [Change button position](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/search-block/\#change-button-position)

![Change button position](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/image4-1024x531.jpg)

This button can be used to change the position of the search button. There are three options to choose from:

- **Button outside** – the default setting.
- **Button inside** – the search button is part of the search text field.
- **No button** – removes the Search button and only displays the Search text field on the page.
- **Button only** – displays only the Search button and hides the Search input text field

### [Use button with icon](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/search-block/\#use-button-with-icon)

The search button can be either text or icon.
