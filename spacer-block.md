If you want to have a space between two blocks, the spacer block is what you will use.

A **vertical** spacer adds space between blocks in a column (as in a page or post).

A **horizontal** spacer adds space between blocks in a row (as in a [Navigation block](https://wordpress.org/support/article/navigation-block/)).

(Note: Using a Navigation block requires a [block theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/) or a theme that has support for [template editing](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/template-editing/).)

In this video, you can see how you can use the spacer block and the different settings to modify it.

Demo of inserting Spacer block into post content and modifying its settings.

To add an _spacer block_, click on the **Add Block** icon.

You can also type /spacer and hit enter in a new _paragraph block_ to add one quickly.

![How to add a space block to a page or post](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28687464/189541348-49772276-96e3-4eac-9fde-4b08df482b83.jpeg)Add Spacer Block

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/spacer-block/\#block-toolbar)

In order to reveal the block toolbar, you can click on the block and the toolbar will display.

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons and blocks specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The Spacer block shows four buttons in the block toolbar:

- Transform to
- Drag icon
- Move arrows
- More options

**Transform to:**

![Transform options for Spacer Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/spacer-transforms.png)Transform options for Spacer Block

When you click on the **“Transform”** button, you can convert the **Spacer** block into **Columns**, **Separator**, **Details**, or **Group** blocks.

- **Separator**: Changes the Spacer into a visual horizontal line that helps divide content, providing a cleaner visual break between sections.
- **Group**: Allows you to wrap the Spacer inside a Group, enabling background color, padding, margin, and border customization for better layout styling.
- **Columns**: Useful if you want to place multiple blocks side-by-side; this transformation helps shift the layout into a multi-column structure.
- **Details**: Converts the Spacer into a collapsible content block, allowing additional context or content to be toggled by the user.

**Drag icon:**

To drag and drop the block to a new location on the page template, click and hold the rectangle of dots, then drag to the new location. The blue separator line indicates where the block will be placed. Release the left mouse button when you find the new location to place the block.

**Move arrows:**

The up and down arrow icons can be used to move a block up and down in your document.

**More options**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/spacer-block/\#block-settings)

Every block has specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar. _If you do not see the sidebar, simply click the ‘cog’ icon next to the Publish button._

**Spacer settings**

The Height setting adjusts the height of the space. The Width setting adjusts the width of the space. You can adjust the settings by either:

- Typing the number in the “Spacer Settings” box, or
- Dragging the handle at the bottom of the spacer (for the vertical spacer) or at the side of the spacer (for the horizontal spacer).

You can also change the unit by clicking on PX to display a dropdown with the other supported units- PX, %, EM, REM, VW, and VH.

![Spacer block settings, showing the supported units](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/image-9.png)The interactive resizable box and the sidebar preset controls used to tweaks the Spacer block.

When Spacer is a child of a flex layout block (Row, Stack, Navigation) custom size controls are removed and flex child controls added instead.

**Dimensions**

Theparagraph provides dimension settings options to add padding and margin. For details refer to this support article:

[Dimension settings overview](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/dimension-controls-overview/)

**Advanced**

The “Advanced” tab lets you add HTML anchor and CSS class(es) to your block.

![Advanced settings for the spacer block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/image-12.png)The advanced section lets you add HTML anchor and a CSS class to your block.

“HTML anchor” allows you to [make a unique web address](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-jumps/) for a particular “Shortcode” block. Then, you’ll be able to link directly to a “Shortcode” block of your page.

The “Additional CSS class(es)” lets you add CSS class(es) to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
