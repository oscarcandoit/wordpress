[Block Patterns](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-pattern/) are a collection of designed core blocks that can be used in posts and pages. They are building blocks to get content created faster. Eg: a subscription form, a Call-to-Action, or a Price List.

[Learn more on how to use Block Patterns](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-pattern/)

The [Block Pattern Directory](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-pattern-directory/) has a myriad of block patterns that work with any site. Themes can reference patterns from the [Directory](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-directory/), without loading them with the theme on every site. This helps to share block patterns from one site to the next.

It is now possible for designers, site builders, and site owners to share their creations with the world and submit their best designs to the [Block Pattern Directory.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-pattern-directory/) This is a great way where #nocode contributors can share their creations with the WordPress community, in addition to the [WordPress Photo Directory](https://wordpress.org/photos/).

## [How to submit a Block Pattern](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/submit-your-block-pattern-to-the-directory/\#how-to-submit-a-block-pattern)

Before your start, [check out the guidelines](https://wordpress.org/patterns/about/) for successfully submitting your pattern.

- Keep placeholder content to a minimum, a few lines will be enough to demonstrate most blocks.
- Use a descriptive name for your pattern. Names like “Test” or “My Pattern” will be declined.

Here is how to create a new Pattern and submit it to the [Block Pattern Directory](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-pattern-directory/):

1. Create an account on [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/)
2. After you log in, go to the [Pattern Creator page](https://wordpress.org/patterns/new-pattern/)
3. On the page, you find a stand-alone [block editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/), where you can create your Block Pattern by adding and arranging the [blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/).
4. Give a **Title** for the Block Pattern.

![Add title for the Block Pattern](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-28-at-11.48.47-AM.png)

5. Now populate the canvas with the available [blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/).
6. Use the Block toolbar and block settings sidebar to configure the blocks.
7. Click **Save draft** to save the pattern as a draft. When you are finished click on the **Submit** button.
8. When you click the **Submit** button, you will be prompted to give your pattern a **Title** and a **Description**. Make it distinct and helpful to the reader.
9. Next, you will be asked to select a **Category** for your pattern. Categories help people find patterns and determine where your pattern will appear in the [WordPress Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/). This also corresponds with the categories listed in the [Pattern Directory](https://wordpress.org/patterns/): Buttons, Columns, Footer, Gallery, Header, Images, Query, Text, and Wireframe.

![Categories for the Block Pattern](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-28-at-11.59.54-AM-1024x636.png)

10. Once you click **Finish**, you will be taken to a **Thank you** dialog. At this stage, your Pattern is pending review. Once your Pattern is approved and published in the [public directory](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-pattern-directory/), you will receive an email.

![Thank you dialog after submitting a Block Pattern](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-28-at-12.03.50-PM-1024x502.png)

## [How to view your Block Patterns](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/submit-your-block-pattern-to-the-directory/\#how-to-view-your-block-patterns)

Click **View my patterns** in the Thank you dialog that appears after you click Submit button [in the previous step](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/submit-your-block-pattern-to-the-directory/#thank-you).

![A modal overlay with text: "Thank you for sharing your pattern!" which appears after saving your pattern](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/P49QKoHMFhQSglEnUq6SWUFZLagOEHhvIP12GJJxOF8U_NC6hLq6zU-0zhbXKBDeUf11yJum0ajWdqaNu6WEdA2tuXwPGD2lRPJpdP0r3jWSmvCB26RIYqmko1q9rb3w0BNC6_Ko)

## [About the media library in the Pattern directory](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/submit-your-block-pattern-to-the-directory/\#about-the-media-library-in-the-pattern-directory)

The Media Library for the Pattern Directory is powered by [Openverse](https://wordpress.org/openverse/). You have direct access to the library of images published in the public domain or with the CC0 license, no attribution is needed.

You can search by keyword and then browse through the results to select the image you’d like to add to your block pattern.

![The Openverse Pattern media modal with a variety of images to choose from.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mGdkFRRjJ9jJIbWmPUTV2XSA0dKNQTZwdzHmTQtjeQ6Hh4rmbhzFpzvDgqIuoXIIiiPmnkhq15p18HGS0R7ZxjKzs-BGB5dZ8d3Mf81b9TXBG0boJSKu7Yt4iwQFI3BSa8Ok6f_P)

Using the [Openverse](https://wordpress.org/openverse/) library helps in the following ways:

- The user of the Block Pattern can be fairly certain they can use the image on their website.
- The creator of the Block Pattern doesn’t have to upload an image to the Block Pattern Directory.
- The image is visible on any site, whether it is locally hosted on someone else’s computer or on their development site, or in production.

## [Restrictions](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/submit-your-block-pattern-to-the-directory/\#restrictions)

As with any public directory on WordPress.org, there are a few restrictions when creating Block Patterns

- You can only use Core blocks to create the Block Patterns.
- You can only use the [Openverse](https://wordpress.org/openverse/) media.
- Only core colors and duotone filters presets are available.
- Images need explicit size value/settings .
- Dynamic blocks won’t work (Query Block, Site Title, etc).

Make sure you read the official [Pattern Directory submission guidelines.](https://wordpress.org/patterns/about/)
