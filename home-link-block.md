[Go to the list of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The **Home Link** block allows you to automatically add a link to your site’s homepage.

**Note**: the **Home Link** block is only available as a sub-block of the [Navigation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/navigation-block/) block

## [How to add the Home Link block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/home-link-block/\#how-to-add-the-home-link-block)

To add a **Home Link** block, you first need to add a [Navigation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/navigation-block/) block in a post or Site Editor. There are three ways you can use to add a **Home Link** block once you add a Navigation block:

- From the sidebar
- From the _Navigation_ block contextual menu
- by converting an existing block

### [From the sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/home-link-block/\#from-the-sidebar)

With the _Navigation_ block selected, click on the ( **+**) icon in the sidebar, and either select the _Home link_ block from the list of your recently used blocks or click on _Browse all_ to show all the available blocks and select it from there.

### [From the Navigation Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/home-link-block/\#from-the-navigation-block)

With the _Navigation_ block selected, click on the ( **+**) icon inside the _Navigation_, and either select the _Home link_ block from the list of your recently used blocks or click on _Browse all_ to show all the available blocks and select it from there.

### [By converting an existing block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/home-link-block/\#by-converting-an-existing-block)

Select an already-existing sub-block inside the _Navigation_ block and click on the icon to the left of the _Drag_ tool, which represents the actual sub-block. Select the _Home link_ block from the drop-down menu.
