The WordPress block editor also called the **block editor**, **WordPress editor** or **Gutenberg** **editor** is the new way of publishing content in WordPress.

Following the launch of WordPress 5.0 in December 2018, the WordPress block editor was set as the default editor and replaced the [classic editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/writing-posts/). To use the [classic editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/writing-posts/), you will need to install the [classic editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) plugin.

The WordPress block editor offers an array of [blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/) that can be used to create media-rich pages and posts.

[Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/) are the content elements that you add to create content layouts. You can add [blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/) for paragraphs, images, headings, lists, videos, galleries, and more. You can control the layout of the blocks with ease, to build visually appealing web pages.

WordPress has blocks for all common content elements, and more can be added through [WordPress plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/blocks/).

- Customize the editing experience.
- Change how you interact with blocks and which blocks appear when searching for a block.
