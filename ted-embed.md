[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The TED embed block lets you add a TED video to your page/post. The embedded video includes a play button that allows users to watch the video on your website.

You cannot embed TED playlists and series.

**Six Steps to embed a TED Video on your post or page**

1. Find the [video on ted.com](https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_mullenweg_why_working_from_home_is_good_for_business) and copy the video URL from the browser bar.

2. Add the TED Embed block to your post.

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/ted-embed/\#block-toolbar)

Besides the Mover and Drag & Drop Handle, the Block Toolbar for the TED embed shows four buttons:

- More Options.

**Transform to**:

You can transform a TED embed to a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the TED embed.

**Change Alignment**

![Alignment options for the TED block: wide width, full width, align left, align center, and align right.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/08-alignment.jpg)

- **Wide width** – Increase the width of the post beyond the content size
- **Full width** – extend the TED embed post to cover the full width of the screen.
- **Align left** – Make the TED embed post left aligned
- **Align center** – Make the TED embed post alignment centered
- **Align right**– Make the TED embed post align right

**Edit URL**

Via the edit URL, you can change the TED Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the “Embed” Button.

![Editing the block URL via the "edit" option.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/09-edit_url.jpg)

**More Options:**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/ted-embed/\#block-settings)

**Media Settings**

![Media settings for the embed block with the toggle OFF for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/18-media_settings_disabled-1-2.jpg)![Media settings for the embed block with the toggle ON for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/17-media_settings_enabled-2.jpg)

Via the _Media Settings_ you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
