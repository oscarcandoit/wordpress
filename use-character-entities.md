## [Character Entities or Extended Characters](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/use-character-entities/\#character-entities-or-extended-characters)

In many WordPress sites, you will see odd symbols that will pop up from time to time. Often these symbols appear in navigation links. For instance, look at the the double left angle quotes **(«)** and the double right angle quotes **(»)** in this example:

```
[« « Previous Post Title](https://wordpress.org/support/article/fun-character-entities/)    |    [Next Post Title » »](https://wordpress.org/support/article/fun-character-entities/)
```

These symbols are called **[HTML](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary#html) character entities** or **extended characters**. They are generated by strange looking code on the web page that the web browser interprets as symbols.

The code that generated the above example looks like this:

```
<?php previous_post_link('&laquo; &laquo; %', '', 'yes'); ?>
| <?php next_post_link('% &raquo; &raquo; ', '', 'yes'); ?>
```

Some of the most popular [HTML](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary#html) _character entities_ are:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| &raquo; | » | double right angle quote |
| &laquo; | « | double left angle quote |
| &lt; | < | single left arrow (left angle bracket) |
| &gt; | > | single right arrow (right angle bracket) |
| &bull; | • | bullet |
| &# 9829; or &hearts; | ♥ | black heart |
| &# 9830; or &diams; | ♦ | black diamond |
| &# 9827; or &clubs; | ♣ | black clubs (shamrock) |
| &# 9824; or &spades; | ♠ | black spade |
| &# 8734; | ∞ | infinity symbol |
| &mdash; | — | long dash |

Note: Remove Space between “&#” and “9829” for black heart. Other symbols are the same.

## [Using Character Entities in WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/use-character-entities/\#using-character-entities-in-wordpress)

Using _character entities_ can be a fun part of your design! You can use these special accents with [template tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) such as the [the\_category()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_category) tag. Note: [the\_category()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_category) [template tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) lists, in [_post meta data_](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Meta_Data_Section) section, the various [categor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary#category) [ies](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Category) assigned to a [post](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary#post).

In this example, the special _character entity_, the heart ( **♥**) symbol, separates the [categories](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary#category) of WordPress, Computers, and Internet News:

```
<?php the_category(' &hearts; ') ?>
```

WordPress ♥ Computers ♥ Internet News

In this example you see the use of an accent in your [post’s title](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_title):

```
<?php the_title('∞ ', ' ∞'); ?>
```

∞ WordPress Makes Me Smile ∞

If you want to highlight the [post’s author](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_author), you don’t have to use a character entity inside of a WordPress template tag. You can use it in the text.

```
<div id="author">&diams; <?php the_author(); ?></div>
```

♦ Harriet Smith

As you have seen, there are a many uses for _character entities_ within your site. With this information you can experiment and find creative ways to use these symbols in your design!

**Note:** Not all [template tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) can use _character entities_, especially those [tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) that use [boolean parameters](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#Boolean). Test a [template tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags)

**thoroughly** to be sure that it will accept the symbols.
