There are three different ways to move or change the position of a block within your post or page from the admin screen of the [WordPress Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/): using the move handles, drag & drop, or using the _Move to_ option in the Block toolbar (under the More options three-dot menu).

## [Using the move handles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/moving-blocks/\#using-the-move-handles)

The move handles are the up and down arrow handles in the Block toolbar of a selected block.

**NOTE**: If you set your WordPress Block Editor to display the Block toolbar pinned to the top of the WordPress block editor (right under the top toolbar) instead of appearing directly above the block, then the move handles will appear right under the top toolbar.

The up and down arrow icons in a Block toolbar can be used to move the selected block up and down in your post or page.

## [Using the drag & drop](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/moving-blocks/\#using-the-drag-drop)

To drag and drop the selected block to a new location on the post or page, use the rectangle of dots in the Block toolbar of the selected block.

![Using the drag and drop](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-07-at-9.58.42-AM.png)

The drag and drop option is not available if you set your WordPress Block Editor to display the Block toolbar pinned to the top of the WordPress block editor (right under the top toolbar) instead of appearing directly above the block.

To drag and drop the selected block, click and hold the rectangle of dots, then drag to the new location. The blue separator line indicates where the block will be placed. Release the left mouse button when you find the new location to place the block.

## [Using the “Move To” option in the block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/moving-blocks/\#using-the-move-to-option)

The _Move to_ option can be found by selecting a block and clicking the three-dot menu in the block toolbar.

**NOTE**: If you set your WordPress Block Editor to display the Block toolbar pinned to the top of the WordPress block editor (right under the top toolbar) instead of appearing directly above the block, then the _Move to_ option can be found following the same steps.

On selecting the _Move to_ option, you will get a blue line inside your content. You can then use the arrows to move that line, up and down to where you want the selected content to be moved. Hitting `return` on your keyboard at that point moves the block to that position
