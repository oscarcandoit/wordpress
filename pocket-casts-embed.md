[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The _Pocket Casts Embed_ block is a new WordPress feature, and a variation of the [Embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/embed-block/). The block enables you to insert any Pocket Casts content, such as a podcast page, an episode, and the time position within an episode, into your post or page.

Keep in mind that you will need to subscribe to a premium Pocket Casts account to add your favorite or own Pocket Casts content into the block.

To add the _Pocket Casts Embed_ block to the editor, click the ( **+**) icon at the top left corner to open the Block Inserter. Search for and then click the _Pocket Casts Embed_ block to add it to the editor.

Alternatively, you can manually insert the _Pocket Casts Embed_ block using the keyboard shortcut `/pocket-casts`.

Once inserted, you can embed a Pocket Casts URL to the block. Here are the steps to insert a podcast page and an episode to the _Pocket Casts Embed_ block:

1. Find a podcast and click on it to open the podcast page. Hover your mouse over the podcast title and click the **Share** button.

Moreover, you can also embed a Pocket Casts URL directly into the block editor. Here are the steps:

1. Create a new post.
2. Copy and paste a Pocket Casts URL into the block editor, for example, [https://pca.st/k2rof194](https://pca.st/k2rof194) or [https://pca.st/qekyjgs6](https://pca.st/qekyjgs6).
3. Check if the URL is replaced by the Pocket Casts player.

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pocket-casts-embed/\#block-toolbar)

The **Edit URL** button only appears after you have embedded the podcast content. It lets you change the _Pocket Casts Embed_’s URL via the Embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and paste a new one on the URL field and click the Embed button to confirm the changes.

**More options**

Details about **More options** can be found in this [support article](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/).

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pocket-casts-embed/\#block-settings)

WordPress blocks have specific configuration options in the block settings panel. To access the _Pocket Casts Embed_ block settings panel, click the **Settings** button at the top-right corner of the WordPress editor. Alternatively, click the **More options** or three dots icon in the _Pocket Casts Embed_ block toolbar and select **Show more settings**.

**Media settings**

![Media settings for the Pocket Casts Embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/media-settings.png)

The Media settings option allows you to control the behavior of the _Pocket Casts Embed_ block when viewed from a smaller device, such as a mobile phone screen. The option only appears after you have embedded the podcast content. The Media settings option is active by default.

When you turn the toggle switch off, the _Pocket Casts Embed_ block may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser’s window is resized. Meanwhile, if the option is active, the block will maintain its aspect ratio regardless of the browser’s window size.

**Advanced**

![Additional CSS Class(es) field for the Pocket Casts Embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/css-classes-1.png)

The Advanced section allows you to add CSS class(es) to the _Pocket Casts Embed_ block. Therefore, you can insert custom CSS styles into the block.
