[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

_Code_ block lets you add and display code snippets for others to view.

_Code_ block example:

```
if ( condition ) {
    action1();
    action2();
} elseif ( condition2 && condition3 ) {
    action3();
    action4();
} else {
    defaultaction();
}
```

To add the _Code_ block, open the block inserter by clicking the ( **+**) icon on the upper left corner of the editor. After that, look for Code using the search bar and click it to insert the block into the editor.

Alternatively, you can type /code on the editor to insert the _Code_ block manually.

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/code-block/\#block-toolbar)

Most blocks have their own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The _Code Block_ shows the following buttons:

- Transform to
- Moving handles
- Bold
- Italic
- Link
- More Rich Text controls
- More options

![Code block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/03/257561204-45bc26bb-f192-4fdd-a870-d3834c91c7f8.png)

### [Transform to](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/code-block/\#transform-to)

The Transform to button lets you change the _Code_ block into a _Paragraph_, _Columns_, _Group_, _Custom HTML_ or _Preformatted blocks_.

![Code block toolbar with the transform option highlighted](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/03/257561888-d7ce127c-9cc4-4396-8a9e-fa443fce8ddf.png)

Transforming the _Code_ block into _Group_ will give you the ability to change the background color around the code.

### [Moving handles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/code-block/\#moving-handles)

The dotted icons can be used to drag and drop a block to the place of your choosing. The up and down arrow icons can be used to shift a block up and down in your document.

![Code block toolbar with moving handles highlighted](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/03/257561238-782eee25-933c-4f66-95b7-439ae8022e28.png)

The _change alignment_ tool lets you align the _Code block_ within the content. You can choose one of the following alignment options:

**None:** Leaves the block alignment as is.

**Wide width:** Increase the block’s width beyond the content size.

### [Bold](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/code-block/\#bold)

You can select the text in the _Code_ block and use the _Bold_ option or **Ctrl+B** / **Cmd+B** on your keyboard to bold it, which is usually heavier than the surrounding text.

### [Italic](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/code-block/\#italic)

![Code block toolbar with italic option highlighted](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/03/257561238-782eee25-933c-4f66-95b7-439ae8022e28-2.png)

You can select the text in the _Code_ block and use the _Italic_ option or **Ctrl+I** / **Cmd+I** on your keyboard to italicize it, which usually appears slanted to the right.

### [Link](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/code-block/\#link)

![Code block toolbar with link option highlighted](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/03/257561238-782eee25-933c-4f66-95b7-439ae8022e28-3.png)
