**Transform to:**

![Transform tool in the Slideshare embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Slideshare-Embed-HelpHub-SS-7-1024x757.png)

You can transform a Slideshare embed to Columns or a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the Slideshare embed.

**Change Alignment:**

- **Wide width** – Increase the width of the post beyond the content size
- **Full width** – extend the Slideshare embed post to cover the full width of the screen.
- **Align left** – Make the Slideshare embed post left aligned
- **Align center** – Make the Slideshare embed post alignment centered
- **Align right**– Make the Slideshare embed post right aligned

_“Wide width” and “Full width” alignment need to be enabled by the Theme of your site._

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/slideshare-embed/\#block-settings)

**Media Settings**

Via the _Media Settings_ you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position, the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
