# Administration Menus

[â†‘ Back to top](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/administration-menus/#wp--skip-link--target)

Administration Menus are the interfaces displayed in WordPress Administration. They allow you to add option pages for your plugin.

For information on managing Navigation Menus, see the Navigation Menus chapter of the Theme Developer Handbook.

## Top-Level Menus and Sub-Menus

The Top-level menus are rendered along the left side of the WordPress Administration. Each menu may contain a set of Sub-menus.

When deciding between [Top-level menus](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/administration-menus/top-level-menus/) and [Sub-menus](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/administration-menus/sub-menus/) think carefully about the needs of your plugin as well as the needs of your end users.

We recommend developers with a single option page to add it as Sub-menu to one of the existing Top-level menus; such as Settings or Tools.
