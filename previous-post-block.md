Every block comes with unique toolbar icons. These block-specific controls allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

![Bold option on the previous post block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/image-14.png)

You can select the text in the _Previous Post_ block and use the _Bold_ option or `Ctrl` + `b` or `Cmd` + `b` on your keyboard to bold it, which is usually heavier than the surrounding text.

### [Italic](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/previous-post-block/\#italic)

![Italic option on the previous post block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/image-15.png)

### [Options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/previous-post-block/\#options)

The More Options menu represented by three vertical dots on the far right of the toolbar gives you more features such as the ability to duplicate, remove, or edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-text-editing-overview/)

## [Block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/previous-post-block/\#block-settings)

The block settings panel contains customization options specific to the block. To open it, select the block and click the cog icon below the block description, in the sidebar.

Click **Display the title as a link** to use the previous post/page title as link text. If you activate this toggle, another toggle **Include the label as part of the link** appears, allowing you to include in the link the custom label (if you have specified one).

Under the **Arrow** section you can select between three options:

- _None_ no arrow is displayed beside the link.
- _Arrow_ displays a left-headed arrow ( **←**) to the left of the link.
- _Chevron_ displays a chevron ( **«**) to the left of the link.

### [Advanced](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/previous-post-block/\#advanced)

The Advanced section lets you add HTML anchor and CSS class(es) to your block. This will allow you to write custom CSS and styles for the block.
