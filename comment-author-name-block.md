The _Comment Author Name_ _block_ displays the username of the comment’s author. This block is nested inside a Comment Query Loop block and lets you customize the appearance of the comment author’s name.

You can only insert the _Comment Author Name Block_ inside a Comment Template block within the Comment Query Loop block.

Click the (+) icon inside the Comment Template block to open the block inserter pop-up window and search for the Comment Author Name block.

You can also use the keyboard shortcut `/comment-name` to quickly insert a Comment Author Name block inside a Comment Template block.
