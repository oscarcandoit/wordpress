Since WordPress 5.0, the [WordPress block editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/) has an easy way to add videos, images, tweets, audio, and other content from third-party services into your WordPress site by embedding. An example of this is embedding a YouTube video in your post or page.

When you are embedding content, you don’t need to upload the content to your WordPress site. You are creating a link to the content, from within your post or page.

Using the generic [Embed Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/embed-block/), you can paste the URL from the third-party site that you want to embed the content such as YouTube, Vimeo, TED, etc on your post or page.

![Embedding content using the Embed block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-16-at-11.31.14-AM-1024x429.png)

You can also use Embed blocks build for specific third-party services such as YouTube Embed, Vimeo Embed, etc.

For a full list of embeds, check out the article: [list of all embed blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/#embeds).

- **Facebook** and **Instagram**: Due to Facebook’s [decision to close the oEmbed end](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/09/22/facebook-and-instagram-embeds-to-be-deprecated-october-24th/) point for embedding Facebook and Instagram links, the block will not work anymore after October 24, 2020. To embed Facebook and Instagram links into your site, you need a developer account and an appid, and provide an authentication token with their call to the endpoint. Refer to the [Facebook Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development).
- **Tumblr** – only posts (name.tumblr.com/post/etc) are recognized, not standalone images (name.tumblr.com/image)
- **Twitter** – older versions of WordPress have issues with https embeds. Remove the ‘s’ from the https to fix the issue.
- **YouTube** – only public and “unlisted” videos and playlists can be embedded. “private” videos cannot be embedded.
