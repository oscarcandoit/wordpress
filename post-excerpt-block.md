[Go to the List of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

Use the Excerpt block to display the excerpt of a post. This block is primarily nested inside a [query loop](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/query-loop-block/) block and helps to customize the appearance of the query loop.

If the post does not have an [excerpt](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/excerpt), the Excerpt block displays the first 55 words in the post as the excerpt, followed by the characters ‘\[…\]’.

The block has an optional **Read More** link which will direct the website visitor to the URL of the full post. You can customize this link text to anything you like. The **Read More** link can be styled independently.
