## [Media Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-media-screen/\#media-settings)

### [Image sizes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-media-screen/\#image-sizes)

The sizes listed below determine the maximum dimensions in pixels to use when inserting an image into the body of a post.

- **Thumbnail size** – Enter the **Width** and **Height**
  - **Crop thumbnail to exact dimensions (normally thumbnails are proportional)** – checkbox
- **Medium size** – Enter the **Max Width** and **Max Height**
- **Large size** – Enter the **Max Width** and **Max Height**

### [Uploading Files](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-media-screen/\#uploading-files)

Default settings used for during the media upload process when writing a post.

- **Organize my uploads into month- and year-based folders** – Check this box if you wish to organize your uploads into folders based on the year and the month of the upload. As of 3.5, wp-content/uploads is the default path setting for the uploads folder. Assuming this is your path setting, if you check this box, a file uploaded in June of 2018 would be placed into the wp-content/uploads/2018/06 folder. Note: At the time of the actual upload, WordPress will automatically create the folders, such as wp-content/uploads/2018 and wp-content/uploads/2018/06, as long as your wp-content folder is writeable.

### [Save Changes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-media-screen/\#save-changes)

Click the **Save Changes** button to ensure any changes you have made to your Settings are saved to your database. Once you click the button, a confirmation text box will appear at the top of the page telling you your settings have been saved.
