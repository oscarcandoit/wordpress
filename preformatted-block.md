[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

If you wish to add text to a post or page that is displayed exactly as you type it, the **Preformatted Block** is for you. You can create one by clicking the **Block Inserter** icon.

You can also type _“/preformatted”_ and hit the enter key in an empty paragraph block to quickly create one.

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)

The **Preformatted Block** shares a lot of similarities with the **Paragraph Block** and the **Code Block** _._ Think of it as a hybrid of the two.

Like **Paragraph Block**, the **Preformatted Block** is intended primarily to display text. Unlike the **Paragraph Block**, though, the **Preformatted Block** keeps any spacing or line breaks exactly as they are entered.

Similar to the **Code Block**, the **Preformatted Block** is displayed in a monospace font, making it easy to keep text perfectly aligned. However, the **Preformatted Block** also includes styling and the ability to add hyperlinks (described below) that a **Code Block** doesn’t have.

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preformatted-block/\#block-toolbar)

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons and block specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The **Preformatted Block** shows the standard eight buttons:

- Change block type or style
- Drag
- Moving handles
- Bold
- Italic
- Hyperlink
- More rich text controls
- More options

### [Change block type or style](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preformatted-block/\#change-block-type-or-style)

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/Preformatted-block-change-block-type-5.9.png)

You can transform the **Preformatted Block** into **Paragraph Block**, **Columns Block**, **Code Block,** or **Group**. The **Group** would give you the ability to change the background color around the **Preformatted Block**.

### [Moving handles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preformatted-block/\#moving-handles)

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/Preformatted-block-move-handles-5.9.png)

The up and down arrow icons can be used to shift a block up and down in your document.

Detailed instructions on moving a block within the editor can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/moving-blocks/).

### [Bold](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preformatted-block/\#bold)

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/Preformatted-block-bold-option-5.9.png)

You can select the text of the block and use the **Bold** option or **Ctrl+B** / **Cmd+B** on your keyboard to bold it, which is usually heavier than the surrounding text.

### [Italic](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preformatted-block/\#italic)

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/Preformatted-block-italic-5.9.png)

You can select the text of the block and use the **Italic** option or **Ctrl+I**/ **Cmd+I** on your keyboard to italicize it, which usually appears slanted to the right.

### [Hyperlink](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preformatted-block/\#hyperlink)

You can select the text of the block and use the **Hyperlink** option.

### [More options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preformatted-block/\#more-options)

The Options menu represented by three vertical dots on the far right of the toolbar gives you more features such as the ability to duplicate or remove the block.

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preformatted-block/\#block-settings)

Every block has specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar. _If you do not see the sidebar, click the ‘cog’ icon next to the Publish button._

### [Color](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preformatted-block/\#color)

### [Typography](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preformatted-block/\#typography)

Typography settings allow you to adjust the Font size, Appearance, Letter case, Line height, and Letter spacing.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/Advanced-block-toolbar-options-5.9.png)

**HTML anchor** allows you to [make a unique web address](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-jumps/) for a particular **Preformatted Block**. Then, you’ll be able to link directly to a **Preformatted Block** of your page.

The **Additional CSS class(es)** lets you add CSS class(es) to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
