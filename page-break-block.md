[Go to the List of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

Use the _page break block_ to separate your content into a multiple-page experience and add pagination, or page breaks, to a page or post. This can be useful if you are writing a step-by-step tutorial or if you’d like to split your page into multiple chapters, for instance.

Page break overview

In order to add a _page break block_, click on the **Block Inserter** icon.

You can also type `/page-break ` and hit enter in a new _paragraph block_ to add one quickly.

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)

You can add as many page breaks as you want to your post or page. Each _page break block_ adds a new number to the multi-page link that appears at the bottom, splitting the content into more pages.

## [Block Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-break-block/\#block-interface)

Each block has its own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor. The _page break block_ has the following options in the Block toolbar.

You can transform a _Page Break block_ into a Columns, or a Group block.

Use the block-moving tools to move the block up and down inside the editor. Use the six dots icon to drag and drop the _Page Break Block_ and reposition it anywhere on the editor. Alternatively, click on the up and down arrows to move the block up or down the editor.

**More options**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-break-block/\#block-settings-panel)

Every block has specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar. _If you do not see the sidebar, simply click the ‘cog’ icon next to the Publish button._

[![Block settings in the Page Break block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/171639821-1df07250-fe04-436e-9646-4837eec2ed2e.png)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/171639821-1df07250-fe04-436e-9646-4837eec2ed2e.png) The block settings can be found in the sidebar.

The page break block doesn’t have any additional options on the sidebar. Once you add it to your page or post you are all set!
