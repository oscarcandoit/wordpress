[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The _Tag Cloud block_ allows adding tag/category cloud into the page/post. A tag cloud is a list of all [tags](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/posts-tags-screen/) /categories on your site, displayed in alphabetical order.

Tag cloud helps your readers to discover and search content easily and quickly.

The _Tag Cloud block_ displays each tag with the font size based on the number of times that tag has been associated with posts. The bigger the size, the more posts are tagged with that tag. This helps your readers know your favorite subjects and the topics you write about most frequently.

## [How to add a Tag Cloud block to your post or page](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/tag-cloud-block/\#how-to-add-a-tag-cloud-block-to-your-post-or-page)

Add the _Tag Cloud block_ to your post or page by clicking on the “Block Inserter” (+) and then search for “Tag Cloud”. Alternatively, you can type `/tag-cloud` in a new paragraph block and press `enter`.

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/)

If you have tags/categories on your site, the _Tag Cloud block_ will display a list of the tags as follows:

If the site doesn’t have any tags then it will display the message as shown below.

![When there are no tags to show, the block displays a text that says "There's no content to show here yet."](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/08/tag-clould-no-content-WP-62-1024x166.png)

**Note:** Tags’ appearance varies based on the selected theme.

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/tag-cloud-block/\#block-toolbar)

Each block has its own block-specific controls that allow you to customize the block right in the editor. The _Tag Cloud block_ offers the following options in its toolbar:

- Transform to
- Drag
- Move handles
- Change alignment
- More Options.

### [Transform to](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/tag-cloud-block/\#transform-to)
