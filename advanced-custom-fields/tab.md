## Description

The Tab field is used to group together fields into tabbed sections.

When editing a field group, be aware that all fields following the Tab field (or until another Tab field is defined) will be grouped together using the Tab field label as the tab heading.

## Settings

- **Placement**


Changes the tab style from a top aligned row to a left aligned sidebar. The `left aligned` option will be ignored if the field group appears in a table element (editing a user, attachment, taxonomy or field group label setting on left).

- **Endpoint**


Defines an endpoint for the previous Tab group. When used in combination with an empty field label, this field can be used as a tab stopper.
