### Display value

Link copied

This example demonstrates how to use a URL field named “sales\_url” within an anchor tag. We don’t recommend outputting any ACF value without any sort of protection or escaping.

```php
<a href="<?php echo esc_attr( get_field('sales_url') ); ?>"><?php echo esc_attr( get_field('sales_url') ); ?></a>
```
