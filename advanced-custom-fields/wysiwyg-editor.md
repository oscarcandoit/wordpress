## Description

Link copied

The Wysiwyg field creates a WordPress content editor as seen in Posts and Pages. Wysiwyg is an acronym for "what you see is what you get".

This is one of the most useful fields for editing content as it allows for both text and multimedia to be edited and styled within a single area.

## Settings

Link copied

- **Default Value**


The default value shown when creating a new post.

- **Tabs**


Selects which modes are shown to the user. Each Wysiwyg editor contains a visual and text mode. Choose from Visual and Text, Visual Only, or Text Only.

- **Toolbar**


Specifies which toolbar to show. Choose from Full or Basic. The Full toolbar reflects the typical WordPress editor toolbar with 2 rows of buttons. The Basic toolbar is a minified single row of buttons useful for a more trimmed experience.

- **Show Media Upload Buttons**


Provides the ability to upload inline media to the Wysiwyg field.

- **Delay initialization?**


Defers initialization of editor until editor is clicked instead of on page load. This is useful to speed up load times.

## Template usage

The Wysiwyg editor field will return your content formatted for HTML in the same manner that [the\_content()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_content/) does.

## Notes

[Link to heading#](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/wysiwyg-editor/#the-acfthecontent-filter)

### The acf\_the\_content filter

Link copied

When loading a Wysiwyg field value, the value is passed through a filter `acf_the_content` to apply HTML formatting. This filter, closely based on the WordPress [the\_content](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/the_content) filter, is used instead to avoid unwanted recursion issues.

If you are using the `the_content` filter to modify content, please be sure to also filter `acf_the_content` as well.
