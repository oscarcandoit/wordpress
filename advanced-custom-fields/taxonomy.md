- **Required**


Enabling this prevents the field from accepting empty values. Defaults to off.

- **Instructions**

- **Conditional Logic**


Enabling this setting allows you to customize the logic which determines if the current field should be visible. Groups of conditional logic rules can be created to allow for multiple and/or statements.

- **Bidirectional**


Found on the Advanced tab, enabling this setting allows you to update a value in the target fields for each value selected for this field, adding or removing the Post ID, Taxonomy ID, or User ID of the item being updated. Please see [Bidirectional Relationships](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/bidirectional-relationships/) for more information on using this setting to create bidirectional relationships directly in ACFâ€™s UI.

The Taxonomy field will return one or more values (objects or IDs) depending on the Return Value setting. Below are some examples of how you can use this data.

### Display single value

Link copied

This example demonstrates how to get and display a single term object. This would imply that your Appearance setting is Radio Buttons or Select.

```php
<?php
$term = get_field('taxonomy_field_name');
if( $term ): ?>
    <h2><?php echo esc_html( $term->name ); ?></h2>
    <p><?php echo esc_html( $term->description ); ?></p>
<?php endif; ?>
```

[Link to heading#](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/taxonomy/#display-multiple-values)

### Display multiple values

Link copied

This example demonstrates how to get and loop over multiple selected term objects. This implies that your Appearance setting is Checkbox or Multi Select.

```php
<?php
$terms = get_field('taxonomy_field_name');
if( $terms ): ?>
    <ul>
    <?php foreach( $terms as $term ): ?>
        <li>
            <h2><?php echo esc_html( $term->name ); ?></h2>
            <p><?php echo esc_html( $term->description ); ?></p>
            <a href="<?php echo esc_url( get_term_link( $term ) ); ?>">View all '<?php echo esc_html( $term->name ); ?>' posts</a>
        </li>
    <?php endforeach; ?>
    </ul>
<?php endif; ?>
```

### Display values from a selected term

Link copied

The Advanced Custom Fields plugin can be used to [add custom fields to taxonomy terms](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/adding-fields-taxonomy-term/).
Building on this, the following examples demonstrate how to load a custom field value from a selected term value.

```php
<?php
$term = get_field('taxonomy_field_name');
if( $term ): ?>
    <h2>Term name: <?php echo esc_html( $term->name ); ?></h2>
    <p>Term color: <?php the_field('color', $term); ?></p>
<?php endif; ?>
```
