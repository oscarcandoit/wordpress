Last updated Jan 3, 2024

## Overview

Link copied

This guide shows how to activate ACF PRO and your license key. Without a valid license key on the WordPress site where it is installed, ACF PRO will not be able to receive plugin updates, or access premium features and field types.

Until a valid license key has been activated for the site, it won’t be possible to create new or edit existing PRO fields— [Gallery](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/gallery/), [Repeater](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/repeater/), [Flexible Content](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/flexible-content/), or [Clone](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/clone/)—or use the premium features such as [Options Pages](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/options-page/), and [ACF Blocks](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/).

If you previously activated a license and the subscription has expired, you will not be able to create new PRO fields, but you will be able to edit existing PRO field definitions. Content editors will still be able to use any existing PRO fields, ACF Blocks, and options pages, but new ones cannot be created.

**The editing and display of field data will be unaffected by the status of the licenses**.

### Installation & Activation

Follow these steps to activate ACF PRO:

1. Download the plugin zip from the Licenses page in [your account](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/my-account/).
2. Install and activate the plugin on your WordPress site.
3. Copy your license key from the Licenses page.
4. Navigate to **ACF > Updates** , enter your license key, and click **Activate License**.

The free ACF plugin is automatically deactivated when you activate ACF PRO on your WordPress Plugins page. Fields, post types, and data created with the free version of ACF will continue to be used by the PRO plugin. You can safely delete the free plugin after installing ACF PRO.

To activate your license, log in to your WordPress admin and navigate to the **ACF > Updates** page.

Enter your license key into the input field and click **Activate**. Once the page reloads, you will be met with a notification that the website will now receive ACF PRO plugin updates.

In the case of an error, please [contact support](https://support.advancedcustomfields.com/new-ticket/) and provide the error message displayed (along with your info).

Please [contact support](https://support.advancedcustomfields.com/new-ticket/) if the correct plugin is activated and you are still unable to navigate to **ACF > Updates**.
