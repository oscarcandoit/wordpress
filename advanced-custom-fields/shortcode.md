## Overview

Link copied

Shortcodes can be used within a WYGIWYG to display another fieldâ€™s value. To learn more about shortcodes, [click here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API).

**From ACF 6.3.0, the ACF shortcode is disabled by default for new installs of ACF. If you need to enable it, see [enabling the ACF shortcode](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/shortcode/#enabling).**

**For security, we recommend [disabling the ACF shortcode](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/shortcode/#disabling) if you are not using it.**

## Usage

Place the shortcode marker with the desired field within your wysiwyg content. This shortcode runs the same as the [the\_field()](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/docs/functions/the_field/ "the_field()") function.

```php
[acf field="field_name" post_id="123"]
```

## Disabling the Shortcode

Link copied

The ACF shortcode allows access to any field on any post type as was enabled by default any install of ACF created before the release of ACF 6.3. This means any user who has permission to publish posts on your site can view any ACF data if they know the field name or key. For this reason, we recommend you disable the shortcode if your site is not using it. You can use the following setting to disable it:

```php
add_action( 'acf/init', 'set_acf_settings' );
function set_acf_settings() {
    acf_update_setting( 'enable_shortcode', false );
}
```

## Enabling the Shortcode

Link copied

When enabled, the ACF shortcode allows access to any field on any post type. This means any user who has permission to publish posts on your site can view any ACF data if they know the field name or key. For this reason, from ACF 6.3 the shortcode is disabled by default for new installs. If you do need to use it, for example for a page builder, you can use the following setting to enable it:

```php
add_action( 'acf/init', 'set_acf_settings' );
function set_acf_settings() {
    acf_update_setting( 'enable_shortcode', true );
}
```
