## What are Field Groups?

Field groups are a fundamental concept in ACF, organizing the custom fields used to store and display data on your WordPress sites. You can think of a field group as a container that holds one or more fields, which can be used to capture specific types of data. For example, you might create a field group called “Additional Post Details” that includes fields for a subtitle, author bio, and featured image.

## Creating a Field Group

The process to [create a field group](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/creating-a-field-group/) is straightforward. Navigate to **ACF > Field Groups** in your WordPress dashboard and click **Add New**. From there, you can add as many fields as you wish, with a great degree of control over each field’s validation, presentation, and conditional logic settings. Field groups also include location rules, allowing you to control on which post types, pages, or other locations the field group should appear.

Once you’ve created a field group and added fields to it, it’s time to render the fields on the frontend of your WordPress site. The video above shows how to use ACF’s developer-friendly functions to retrieve and display the values of your custom fields in your theme templates.
