## Developer Notes

We made some changes. Here are the ones you should know about.

| Name | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| ACF PRO | We have moved away from selling individual add-ons towards an all inclusive PRO plugin!<br>Because **ACF PRO** is a single plugin combining ACF with all our premium features, we can deliver a higher standard of product including:<br>1. More features, more often<br>2. Better compatibility<br>3. Faster updates (less plugins)<br>4. Faster websites (less assets)<br>To learn more about premium features, please checkout the [ACF PRO](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) page. |
| ACF 5 | Welcome to the future! ACF version 5 is our latest architecture powering both our free and PRO plugins.<br>Although sometimes confused as the same, ACF 5 is simply "version 5" - the next major version scheduled for release this year and currently available via [Early Access](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/upgrade-guide-version-5/). ACF PRO is our professional plugin that combines ACF 5 with our premium features such as the repeater field. |
| Add-ons | Now that ACF PRO is distributing our premium functionality, we will no longer develop individual Add-ons and will eventually remove them from the website. |
| Database Upgrade | After updating to ACF 5, you will be prompted to upgrade the Database.<br>This is a necessary step to migrate across your field and field group settings from version 4.x. This upgrade will also copy across any taxonomy term values from the 'wp\_options' table to the 'wp\_termmeta' table.<br>No data is deleted or modified during this upgrade. |
| Template Functions | No changes to report here üòÅ. You can expect every `get_field()` and `the_field()` to work just the same! |
| Field Groups | Field Group settings are saved in the wp\_posts table _(same as before)_ but with a post\_type of **'acf-field-group'** (previously 'acf'). New settings have also been added including Active, Label Placement, Instructions Placement and Description. |
| Fields | Field settings are now also saved in the wp\_posts table with a post type of **'acf-field'**. New settings have also been added including Wrapper Attributes, Return Type and many more depending on the field type! |
| wp\_termmeta | Taxonomy term values are now saved to the 'wp\_termmeta' table _(previously saved to the wp\_options table)_. No change is required to template code as the database upgrade will copy across all taxonomy term values to the wp\_termmeta table. |
| select2 | ACF 5 includes the Select2 JS library for powerful AJAX based selection in many of it's field's (select, post\_type, taxonomy, user)! |
| Markup | ACF 5 produces new and improved HTML, CSS and JS throughout the plugin allowing for a faster experience and better customisation! Within these changes is a different class naming for field wrapper elements:<br>This change looks like `<div class="field_type-{$type}">` to `<div class="acf-field-{$type}">`, and although minor, may cause issues with existing custom CSS and JS. If your theme relies on the old class names, you can easily add them with the following code:<br>```php<br>/* Enable ACF 4 class names */<br>add_filter('acf/compatibility/field_wrapper_class', '__return_true');<br>``` |
| $\_POST | Field values are now sent in the $\_POST data using `$_POST['acf']` instead of `$_POST['fields']`. |
| Export | ACF version 5 includes a .json based export and import tool. Previous version of ACF used the WP .xml export which is currently not compatible. We will be working on a solution for this shortly! |

## FAQ

Have questions? We have answers.

## Do I need to make any changes?

No, you do not need to make any changes to your theme. ACF PRO is still the same plugin you use and love, and will work in the same way. If your theme contains heavy ACF customisation, it will be wise to review your code and check for any issues.

## Do I need both ACF and ACF PRO?

No, ACF PRO is an independent plugin and does not require the free version to be installed. Once ACF PRO is active, you can deactivate the free version and any ACF premium add-ons.

## Will my Add-ons work?

Premium ACF Add-ons are no longer needed when ACF PRO is installed. ACF PRO contains all our premium functionaily wrapped up in a single easy to install plugin!

Any 3rd party plugin that supports ACF5 will work the same in ACF PRO.

## Do I need to buy ACF PRO?

Yes, ACF PRO is a premium plugin and requires a license purchase to access the plugin files. [View License Pricing](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)

## Can I roll back?

Yes, although it is a manual process. All versions of the ACF plugin can be [found here](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/downloads/). Simply download, extract and replace your 'plugins/advanced-custom-fields' plugin folder.

## Should I backup?

It is always a good idea to backup your website before updating a plugin to a new major version, however, this is not required. ACF version 5 does not delete or modify any existing data during the 'DB Upgrade' - only new data is created.
