## Description

Link copied

Used to output additional `<head>` HTML to pages where ACF fields appear.

This action is similar to the WordPress [admin\_head](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_head), except that it is only fired on pages where ACF fields appear â€“ such as when editing posts, users, taxonomy terms, options pages and [front-end forms](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/wordpress-frontend-form/).
