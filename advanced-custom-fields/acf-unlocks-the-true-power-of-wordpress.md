## The Limitations of Default WordPress Meta Fields

Out of the box, WordPress allows users to edit the title and content of a post or page, but what about the plethora of other data required to accurately represent complex content? Native WordPress custom fields aren’t user friendly, and don’t play well with more complex data types like dates or dropdowns. You could code extra areas of the edit screen, but that requires valuable development time and effort.
