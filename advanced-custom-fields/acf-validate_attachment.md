## Description

Link copied

Used to perform custom validation on an attachment and prevent it being uploaded or selected for a specific field.

Similar to the [acf/upload\_prefilter](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/acf-upload_prefilter/) filter, this filter can be used to prevent an upload, however, it can also be used to prevent an attachment being selected from a WP media modal.
