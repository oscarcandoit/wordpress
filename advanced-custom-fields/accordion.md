## Description

Link copied

The Accordion field is used to organize fields into collapsible panels.

Each Accordion displays a clickable title generated by the field’s label and instructions, and a collapsible content panel where neighboring fields will be moved within.

When editing a field group, be aware that all fields following an Accordion field (or until another Accordion field is defined) will be added to the Accordion’s content panel.
