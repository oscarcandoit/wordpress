## Description

Link copied

Used to modify the capability required to parse the ACF shortcode over AJAX requests, commonly used by third party site builder plugins. By default, this is set to `edit_posts`.

If you return false from this filter, no capability check will be carried out by ACF. In this case, you **must** validate access in your filter code before returning false to ensure logged out or subscribers users are unable to access ACF data.
