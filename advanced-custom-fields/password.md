### Get value

Link copied

It’s unlikely you’re going to want to output password fields to the frontend, but rather use the value in other code. The following example shows how to load the value of the field “password” from an ACF [options page](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/options-page/).

```php
$value = get_field( "password", "option");
```
