## [What is an Excerpt](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-is-an-excerpt-block-editor/\#what-is-an-excerpt)

Excerpt is an optional text associated to a Post. Most of the time, it is used as the **Post summary**.

Can’t find the Excerpt editing box? Check your **Document** tab at the right of your page. The Excerpt box is just after the Featured Image section.

Regarding the Theme you are using on your site, Excerpts can be displayed on different pages (search results, archives, etc.).

If Excerpt is empty, WordPress automatically creates an excerpt using the first 55 words of the post.

## [How to display Excerpts on the Posts page](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-is-an-excerpt-block-editor/\#how-to-display-excerpts-on-the-posts-page)

1. Go to **Settings > Reading**.
2. Scroll to **For each article in a feed, show**.
3. Select **Summary**.
