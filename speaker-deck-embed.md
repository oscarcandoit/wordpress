The Speaker Deck embed block will allow users to embed their own slides/presentation in their post/page. Users need to create an account to upload their own slides/presentation on Speaker Deck. You don’t need a Speaker Deck account to embed a presentation, although it needs to be public.

You can transform a Speaker Deck embed to a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the Speaker Deck embed.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/speaker-deck-embed/\#block-settings)

Besides the Advanced section, the Speaker Deck embed has only one setting in the “Block Settings” sidebar: Media Settings.

**Media Settings**

![Media settings for the embed block with the toggle ON for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/image-28.png)

Via the Media Settings you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
