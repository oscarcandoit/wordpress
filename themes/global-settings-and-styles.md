# Global Settings and Styles (theme.json)

[↑ Back to top](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/#wp--skip-link--target)

Welcome to the Global Settings and Styles documentation. In this chapter you will learn everything you need to know about configuring settings, styles, and more via your theme’s `theme.json` file.

`theme.json` is a foundational piece of block theming. While it is not a strictly required file, you will need to work with it for nearly any theme project. It is useful for everything from configuring colors to defining default typography settings to applying front-end styles to your theme.
