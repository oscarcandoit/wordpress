[↑ Back to top](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/classic-themes/basics/#wp--skip-link--target)

In this chapter, you’ll begin learning how to build a theme. The anatomy of a theme and its parts will be broken down and explained.

You’ll begin by understanding the concepts of building a theme by looking at [theme files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/) and [post types](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/post-types/). Then you’ll learn how to keep your files [organized](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/organizing-theme-files/) within your theme.

You’ll also look at [The Loop](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/ "The Loop"), which is responsible for pulling content out of the WordPress database.

Finally, you’ll learn more about adding features to your theme by [using theme functions](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/theme-functions/ "Theme Functions"), [including CSS & JavaScript](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/including-css-javascript/ "Including CSS & JavaScript"), leveraging [conditional tags](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/conditional-tags/ "Conditional Tags") to only show content you need, and working with [default taxonomies and creating your own](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/categories-tags-custom-taxonomies/).
