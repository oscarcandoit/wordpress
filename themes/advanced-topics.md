Welcome to the advanced theme topics documentation. In this chapter, you will learn about some of the more complex features, techniques, and more that are not covered in previous chapters.

While this chapter is considered “advanced” it doesn’t mean you cannot learn something if you’re still getting started on your theme development journey. In many ways, the articles in this chapter are essential if you plan to distribute your theme to others, such as through the [WordPress Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/).
