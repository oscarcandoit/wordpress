Welcome to the Features documentation. In this chapter, you will learn about various features supported by the WordPress block theming system.

This chapter does not have a singular focus. Instead, it offers information on several different topics that will help you work with more advanced features, stepping beyond the basics that you learned in [Global Settings and Styles](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/) and [Templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/).

## Navigating this chapter

Use the following links to locate a topic within this chapter. Each article covers a specific feature related to building block themes, and you can explore each at your own pace.

- [**Block Style Variations**](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/features/block-style-variations/) **:** Build custom block style variations (aka: block styles) for your users to select.
- [**Block Stylesheets**](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/features/block-stylesheets/) **:** Register per-block stylesheets to compartmentalize your custom CSS and make your theme load faster.
- [**Block Variations**](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/features/block-variations/) **:** Register variations on the default settings for a block and let your users add them via the interface.
