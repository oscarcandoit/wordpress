# How to use the View feature

[↑ Back to top](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/how-to-use-the-preview-function/#wp--skip-link--target)

The **View** button is available in the top toolbar in the [WordPress Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/) and [Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/). It’s used to preview what your post, page, or site looks like with the current changes applied.

In the [WordPress Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/), click the **Save** button in the top toolbar to keep your changes as a draft of the post or page you’re working on. If you’re in the [Site Editor,](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/) click the **Save** button in the top toolbar to keep the changes you made to your site and the templates you’re working on.

Now click the **View** button to see how your changes look on the front end for the post or page or for the site.
