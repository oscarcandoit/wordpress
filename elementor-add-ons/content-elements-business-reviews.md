Google has completely went to trash, everything I've googled lately gives me all kinds of mixed answers, or just no answers at all. They have too much power, they're monopoly and they need new leadership. They are no with holding simple information to control the masses and there needs to be a stop put to it.

Leaving this here as a general review of Google's customer service...

I have opened 3 different tickets in the last 3 weeks, attempting to get help resolving a matter affecting my business involving a review bomb and subsequent suspension of reviews for my business. The first response I received was not adequate, and I have replied to that email for additional assistance.

That email was never answered. I opened up another ticket, and the response was that "you have already contacted us and this issue has been resolved" when in fact it had not.

I contacted someone via a chat feature and was told "the review team" will get back with me via email. They never did. I opened up a third ticket after this fact, detailing everything that had happened and the fact that I still needed assistance.

I just received a THIRD automated response stating the matter has been resolved in a previous ticket.... It has, in fact, not been resolved! This has been a completely ridiculous process, and wholly inadequate.

Misleading Google Maps directions caused serious travel delay

I used Google Maps for navigation between Kosovo and Montenegro, and it directed me to the Kontrolli Kufitar Qakorr (RKS) border crossing — which does NOT allow vehicles. There were no warnings or restrictions shown, and border officials turned me back, forcing me to lose over an hour and additional fuel in a remote mountainous area.

It’s unacceptable that a company with such massive data and AI capabilities still routes travelers through unusable crossings — and makes it nearly impossible to report the issue from the app.

Google should implement an AI system that automatically detects failed routes (e.g. drivers turning around) and prompts users to confirm problems, so these dangerous mistakes don’t keep happening to other travelers.

Please fix your maps and your feedback process — people rely on this app in foreign countries, and errors like this are more than just inconvenient.

Both photos below were taken on the new Google 10 Pro just minutes apart and unedited (except for the white dot in the middle of the first one) to depict the location of the second picture. The first picture with no zoom and the second with full zoom of the house a mile away. Best cell phone camera I have seen to date!!!!!!

Google Maps support still hasn’t verified my business listing after a month of escalations. I’ve passed them leases, done the video verification, and submitted multiple times. I need real help with this issue.

Both photos below were taken on the new Google 10 Pro just minutes apart and unedited (except for the white dot in the middle of the first one) to depict the location of the second picture. The first picture with no zoom and the second with full zoom of the house a mile away. Best cell phone camera I have seen to date!!!!!!

Google Maps support still hasn’t verified my business listing after a month of escalations. I’ve passed them leases, done the video verification, and submitted multiple times. I need real help with this issue.

Google has completely went to trash, everything I've googled lately gives me all kinds of mixed answers, or just no answers at all. They have too much power, they're monopoly and they need new leadership. They are no with holding simple information to control the masses and there needs to be a stop put to it.

Leaving this here as a general review of Google's customer service...

I have opened 3 different tickets in the last 3 weeks, attempting to get help resolving a matter affecting my business involving a review bomb and subsequent suspension of reviews for my business. The first response I received was not adequate, and I have replied to that email for additional assistance.

That email was never answered. I opened up another ticket, and the response was that "you have already contacted us and this issue has been resolved" when in fact it had not.

I contacted someone via a chat feature and was told "the review team" will get back with me via email. They never did. I opened up a third ticket after this fact, detailing everything that had happened and the fact that I still needed assistance.

I just received a THIRD automated response stating the matter has been resolved in a previous ticket.... It has, in fact, not been resolved! This has been a completely ridiculous process, and wholly inadequate.

Misleading Google Maps directions caused serious travel delay

I used Google Maps for navigation between Kosovo and Montenegro, and it directed me to the Kontrolli Kufitar Qakorr (RKS) border crossing — which does NOT allow vehicles. There were no warnings or restrictions shown, and border officials turned me back, forcing me to lose over an hour and additional fuel in a remote mountainous area.

It’s unacceptable that a company with such massive data and AI capabilities still routes travelers through unusable crossings — and makes it nearly impossible to report the issue from the app.

Google should implement an AI system that automatically detects failed routes (e.g. drivers turning around) and prompts users to confirm problems, so these dangerous mistakes don’t keep happening to other travelers.

Please fix your maps and your feedback process — people rely on this app in foreign countries, and errors like this are more than just inconvenient.
