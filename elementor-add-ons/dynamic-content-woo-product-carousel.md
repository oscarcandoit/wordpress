## **Step 1: Get Figma API Key from the Account** [\#](https://essential-addons.com/docs/woo-product-carousel/\#0-toc-title)

First, go to your [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/) website and sign in to your Figma account. After that, go to the profile avatar on the top right and click on the dropdown. Select the **‘Settings’** from there.

After clicking on ‘Generate new token’, you will find an option to give a name for your personal access token. Give a name to the token and select specific scopes for the API key. Here, select these two scopes for generating the API key:

Current user – Read-only

File content – Read-only

Then click on the **‘Generate token’** button.

## **Step 2: Paste the API Key in Your Figma App** [\#](https://essential-addons.com/docs/woo-product-carousel/\#1-toc-title)

Now, you have to paste the API key into your Figma app to tell the API to fetch the image from your Figma website. To do that, first you have to [**download the Figma app**](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) on your Windows or Mac. Then install it on your device.

Then, from your Figma app, select a design where you want to paste your API key.
