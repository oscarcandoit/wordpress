## [Tools → Export](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/tools-export-screen/\#tools-%e2%86%92-export)

Exporting your WordPress data (posts, pages, custom post types, comments, custom fields, categories, tags, custom taxonomies, and users) is sometimes necessary and useful. If you are moving to a new host or just want a backup of your site data, then Exporting your site is the answer. Once the export file is created, that file can be used for import by the [Tools Import Screen.](https://wordpress.org/support/articles/tools-import-screen/)

The **Tools Export Screen** is quite simple–just specify the desired Filters, if any, you wish to apply, and then click the Download Export File button to save that file to your local computer.
